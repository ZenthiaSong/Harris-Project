__________________

**Significance**

Large rivers transport water and sediment to floodplains and oceans, supplying the nutrients that sustain life. They also transport carbon, removed from the atmosphere during mineral dissolution reactions, which is thought to provide a key negative climate feedback on long timescales. We demonstrate that the (million-year) carbon flux associated with mineral dissolution has been overestimated by up to 28% because of a reactive pool of elements transported with river-borne suspended sediment. This is most acute in regions of high erosion, where silicate weathering is thought to be most intense.

**Abstract**

Rivers carry the dissolved and solid products of silicate mineral weathering, a process that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and provides a key negative climate feedback over geological timescales. Here we show that, in some river systems, a reactive exchange pool on river suspended particulate matter, bonded weakly to mineral surfaces, increases the mobile cation flux by 50%. The chemistry of both river waters and the exchange pool demonstrates exchange equilibrium, confirmed by Sr isotopes. Global silicate weathering fluxes are calculated based on riverine dissolved sodium (Na+) from silicate minerals. The large exchange pool supplies Na+ of nonsilicate origin to the dissolved load, especially in catchments with widespread marine sediments, or where rocks have equilibrated with saline basement fluids. We quantify this by comparing the riverine sediment exchange pool and river water chemistry. In some basins, cation exchange could account for the majority of sodium in the river water, significantly reducing estimates of silicate weathering. At a global scale, we demonstrate that silicate weathering fluxes are overestimated by 12 to 28%. This overestimation is greatest in regions of high erosion and high sediment loads where the negative climate feedback has a maximum sensitivity to chemical weathering reactions. In the context of other recent findings that reduce the net CO2 consumption through chemical weathering, the magnitude of the continental silicate weathering fluxes and its implications for solid Earth CO2 degassing fluxes need to be further investigated.",Positive,Undefined

_____________

**Abstract**

Scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are central to climate science and policy. Recent studies find that observed trends and International Energy Agency (IEA) projections of global CO2 emissions have diverged from emission scenario outlooks widely employed in climate research. Here, we quantify the bases for this divergence, focusing on Kaya Identity factors: population, per-capita GDP, energy intensity (energy consumption/GDP), and carbon intensity (CO2 emissions/energy consumption). We compare 2005-2017 observations and IEA projections to 2040 of these variables, to ""baseline"" scenario projections from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in the upcoming Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We find that the historical divergence of observed CO2 emissions from baseline scenario projections can be explained largely by slower-than-projected per-capita GDP growth—predating the COVID-19 crisis. We also find carbon intensity divergence from baselines in IEA's projections to 2040. IEA projects less coal energy expansion than the baseline scenarios, with divergence expected to continue to 2100. Future economic growth is uncertain, but we show that past divergence from observations makes it unlikely that per-capita GDP growth will catch up to baselines before mid-century. Some experts hypothesize high enough economic growth rates to allow per-capita GDP growth to catch up to or exceed baseline scenarios by 2100. However, we argue that this magnitude of catch-up may be unlikely, in light of: headwinds such as aging and debt, the likelihood of unanticipated economic crises, the fact that past economic forecasts have tended to over-project, the aftermath of the current pandemic, and economic impacts of climate change unaccounted-for in the baseline scenarios. Our analyses inform the rapidly evolving discussions on climate and development futures, and on uses of scenarios in climate science and policy.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

___________________

**Summary**

While twentieth century sea-level rise was dominated by thermal expansion of ocean water, mass loss from glaciers and ice sheets is now a larger annual contributor. There is uncertainty on how ice sheets will respond to further warming, however, reducing confidence in twenty-first century sea-level projections. In 2019, to address the uncertainty, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that sea-level rise from the 1950s levels would likely be within 0.61–1.10 m if warming exceeds 4°C by 2100. The IPCC acknowledged greater sea-level increases were possible through mechanisms not fully incorporated in models used in the assessment. In this perspective, we discuss challenges faced in projecting sea-level change and discuss why the IPCC's sea-level range for 2100 under strong warming is focused at the low end of possible outcomes. We argue outcomes above this range are far more probable than below it and discuss how decision makers may benefit from reframing IPCC's terminology to avoid unintentionally masking worst-case scenarios.",Positive,Global stance

_________________

**Plain Language Summary**

We have produced a new version of a dataset that measures changes of near‐surface temperature across the globe from 1850 to 2018, called HadCRUT5. We have included an improved dataset of sea‐surface temperature, which better accounts for the effects of changes through time in how measurement were made from ships and buoys at sea. We have also included an expanded compilation of measurements made at weather stations on land.

There are two variations of HadCRUT5, produced for different uses. The first, the “HadCRUT5 non‐infilled dataset”, maps temperature changes on a grid for locations close to where we have measurements. The second, the “HadCRUT5 analysis”, extends our estimates to locations further from the available measurements using a statistical technique that makes use of the spatial connectedness of temperature patterns. This improves the representation of less well observed regions in estimates of global, hemispheric and regional temperature change.

Together, these updates and improvements reveal a slightly greater rise in near‐surface temperature since the nineteenth century, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, which is more consistent with other datasets. This increases our confidence in our understanding of global surface temperature changes since the mid‐nineteenth century.

**Abstract**

We present a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit global surface temperature dataset, HadCRUT5. HadCRUT5 presents monthly average near‐surface temperature anomalies, relative to the 1961‐1990 period, on a regular 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid from 1850 to 2018. HadCRUT5 is a combination of sea‐surface temperature measurements over the ocean from ships and buoys and near‐surface air temperature measurements from weather stations over the land surface. These data have been sourced from updated compilations and the adjustments applied to mitigate the impact of changes in sea‐surface temperature measurement methods have been revised. Two variants of HadCRUT5 have been produced for use in different applications. The first represents temperature anomaly data on a grid for locations where measurement data are available. The second, more spatially complete, variant uses a Gaussian process based statistical method to make better use of the available observations, extending temperature anomaly estimates into regions for which the underlying measurements are informative. Each is provided as a 200‐member ensemble accompanied by additional uncertainty information. The combination of revised input datasets and statistical analysis results in greater warming of the global average over the course of the whole record. In recent years, increased warming results from an improved representation of Arctic warming and a better understanding of evolving biases in sea‐surface temperature measurements from ships. These updates result in greater consistency with other independent global surface temperature datasets, despite their different approaches to dataset construction, and further increase confidence in our understanding of changes seen.",Positive,Global stance

____________________

**A decline in the carbon fertilization effect**

One source of uncertainty in climate science is how the carbon fertilization effect (CFE) will contribute to mitigation of anthropogenic climate change. Wang et al. explored the temporal dynamics of CFE on vegetation photosynthesis at the global scale. There has been a decline over recent decades in the contribution of CFE to vegetation photosynthesis, perhaps owing to the limiting effects of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This declining trend has not been adequately accounted for in carbon cycle models. CFE thus has limitations for long-term mitigation of climate change, and future warming might currently be underestimated.

**Abstract**

The enhanced vegetation productivity driven by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO₂) [i.e., the CO₂ fertilization effect (CFE)] sustains an important negative feedback on climate warming, but the temporal dynamics of CFE remain unclear. Using multiple long-term satellite- and ground-based datasets, we showed that global CFE has declined across most terrestrial regions of the globe from 1982 to 2015, correlating well with changing nutrient concentrations and availability of soil water. Current carbon cycle models also demonstrate a declining CFE trend, albeit one substantially weaker than that from the global observations. This declining trend in the forcing of terrestrial carbon sinks by increasing amounts of atmospheric CO₂ implies a weakening negative feedback on the climatic system and increased societal dependence on future strategies to mitigate climate warming.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions
,2020,12,"Peatlands - currently excluded from the main Earth System Models used for climate change projections - are expected to shift from an overall ""sink"" (absorbing carbon) to a source this century, potentially releasing 100 billion tons of carbon by 2100, although uncertainties remain large.","So just how much is 100 billion tons of carbon (or 100 Petagrams of carbon [PgC]) in terms of CO₂?

_________________

The atomic mass for carbon (C) is 12 grams per mole.

The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is 16 grams per mole.

CO₂ is therefore C+(2•O)= 44 grams per mole (12+(2•16)).

The ratio of carbon in this overall molar mass is equal to 12/44 = 0.27

The ratio of molar mass is also equal to the ratio of mass in grams. Therefore, there are 0.27 g of C for every gram of CO₂.

To convert from C to CO₂ we simply divide the total amount of C by the ratio... in this case 100 PgC / 0.27 results in 370 PgCO₂ or 370 GtCO₂ (to go from CO₂ to C the ratio is 44/12 or 3.67). 

The conversion tables of the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/pns/convert.html#3.) show that 1 part per million (ppm) of atmospheric CO₂ is equivalent to 2.13 Gigatonnes Carbon (GtC). Using our ratios from above then, 1ppm atmospheric CO₂ = 7.81 GtCO₂. So 370 GtCO₂ is therefore equal to 47.4 ppm. Now we know that 100 PgC is the same as increasing atmospheric CO₂ by 47.4 ppm. The global growth rate of atmospheric CO₂ since 2017 has been around 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm yr^-1 . 47.4 ppm by 2100, represents a rather large fraction then, averaging an additional 0.6° C yr^-1",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

The carbon balance of peatlands is predicted to shift from a sink to a source this century. However, peatland ecosystems are still omitted from the main Earth system models that are used for future climate change projections, and they are not considered in integrated assessment models that are used in impact and mitigation studies. By using evidence synthesized from the literature and an expert elicitation, we define and quantify the leading drivers of change that have impacted peatland carbon stocks during the Holocene and predict their effect during this century and in the far future. We also identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the scientific community and provide insight towards better integration of peatlands into modelling frameworks. Given the importance of the contribution by peatlands to the global carbon cycle, this study shows that peatland science is a critical research area and that we still have a long way to go to fully understand the peatland–carbon–climate nexus.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

,2020,12,The Keeling Curve : Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from 1958 to 2019,"I never said co2 doesn't play a role. But the oceans don't cool themselves. Mechanisms are important. When Wegener proposed continental drift, he had no mechanism. Turned out, he was right, but his idea lacked acceptance without the mechanism of convection driven plate tectonics, which, by the way, also play a significant role in climate. 

The mechanism is not co2, it's Milankovitch. CO2 feedback is a consequence. Whether Milankovitch effects are prevented by a rise in co2 is conjecture, as we do not have the luxury of the time required to make the observation.

And I don't care for ""if not for this, then what?"" arguments in science, as presented in your citations. You are free to accept them. Again, that doesn't mean we should summarily dismiss them. Regoliths, no doubt, play a role in co2 reduction.

As far as being unsupported, I gave reference to D-O events as anomalies. You did not comment on these rapid events, likely linked to ocean currents, but to date, without mechanism. This doesn't put a hole in co2 feedback levels outright, and consistency may well be developed, but there is a difference between facts and conjecture. Citations do not eliminate speculation contained therein. Indeed, much good science starts with speculation and plausibility. Still, at a minimum, a firm and oft quoted statement like ""our current rate of rapid warming is unprecedented"" is not factual. D-O events establish relatively frequent, and more importantly, rapid warming events.

I will happily remove myself from your sub. I try to call it like I see it. Oftentimes I'm wrong, and when I am, I learn something. Scientists should not fear being challenged, even from a dirtbag like me. Climate change is an observation of the chaotic interplay of multiple variables, always. IMO, oversimplification is leading this highly complex and nascent discipline to single mindedness and groupthink, missing important steps, but I could be wrong.

BTW, defining alarmism is admittedly difficult, and it is probably demeaning, which I shouldn't do. My point is that objectivity invariably suffers when emotion is injected. This compounds the effects of oversimplification.

I hope we are not arguing about what drove glaciation. While climate is always the result of multiple causation, Milankovitch cycles are the accepted driver, don't you agree? And yes, I acknowledge a feedback role with co2. What is speculative is how much of a role. 

And a signal is just that. It's evidence, but as you appear to acknowledge, or at least your sources do, climate is always the result of multiple mechanisms. CO2 always rises in response to T rises, and drops as T drops, as a function of ocean solubility. It doesn't mean co2 doesn't have an effect, but it does mean great care must be taken to not reach a premature conclusion.

As far as a rapid rate, I'll assume you accept that D O events and the Younger Dryas occurred, as you specialize in quaternary geology. These anomalous events suggest we might not have unraveled everything we need to know. They also suggest that once again, co2 is not always driving climate. If anything, since you brought it up, evidence from the PETM, which us old guys called an Optimum, reinforces that a rise in T causes biomass and diversity to increase, though the forams of the day suffered greatly. Change has both negative and positive consequences. Always. And yes, extinctions were real, fortunately for us, a direct result of new evolutionary opportunism.

&gt;Scientific discussion meeting organised by Professor Gavin Foster, Professor Jim Zachos, Professor Dan Lunt and Professor Pincelli Hull. 

&gt;Earth’s history is peppered with rapid and extreme global warming events collectively known as hyperthermals. Although none were as rapid as human-induced climate change, most are associated with major extinction events and were invariably caused by the injection of huge volumes of carbon into the ancient atmosphere. In this meeting we explore what we can learn about our possible future from these dramatic ancient events.""

Note the following two well established statements that disagree with your previous comment:

(a) A key difference between what we are currently doing to the Earth System and what happened during these hyperthermal events however is the rate of current change is much much faster. 

(b) Given that the rate of carbon addition during our “anthropogenic hyperthermal” eclipses that of the Palaeocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)...

________________

**Abstract**

The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan account for 70% of Canada’s methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. In 2018, the Government of Canada introduced methane regulations to reduce emissions from the sector by 40–45% from the 2012 levels by 2025. Complementary to inventory accounting methods, the effectiveness of regulatory practices to reduce emissions can be assessed using atmospheric measurements and inverse models. Total anthropogenic (oil and gas, agriculture, and waste) emission rates of methane from 2010 to 2017 in Alberta and Saskatchewan were derived using hourly atmospheric methane measurements over a six-month winter period from October to March. Scaling up the winter estimate to annual indicated an anthropogenic emission rate of 3.7 ± 0.7 MtCH4/year, about 60% greater than that reported in Canada’s National Inventory Report (2.3 MtCH4). This discrepancy is tied primarily to the oil and gas sector emissions as the reported emissions from livestock operations (0.6 MtCH4) are well substantiated in both top-down and bottom-up estimates and waste management (0.1 MtCH4) emissions are small. The resulting estimate of 3.0 MtCH4 from the oil and gas sector is nearly twice that reported in Canada’s National Inventory (1.6 MtCH4).",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

_____________

**Abstract**

Glacial floods (jökulhlaups) are a phenomenon of some temperate ice masses; they are a significant natural hazard but their complex hydrology is incompletely understood. We document a jökulhlaup from a subglacial lake in Iceland that was inadvertently triggered by a borehole drilled through the overlying ice. We propose that that this borehole allowed an englacial water body to drain into the lake, inducing a transient rise in pressure that overwhelmed the lake's subglacial seal five days later. Runaway melting of a subglacial conduit by 4°C lake water then initiated a flood to the outlet glacier margin. This incident suggests that draining of englacial water bodies via hydro‐fracturing crevasses as well as flooding of moulins by precipitation events are potential natural triggers of jökulhlaups, and explains a correlation between surface melting and jökulhlaups. This hydraulic trigger could have wider implications for relations between meteorological conditions, drainage, and dynamics of some glaciers.

**Plain Language Summary**

Some ice caps and mountain glaciers contain water bodies that drain episodically and catastrophically as subglacial floods, sometimes threatening human life and property. Our observations suggest that we unintentionally triggered such a flood from a subglacial lake in Iceland by boring through the overlying ice. Our conduit allowed water inside the glacier to drain into the lake, causing the pressure to rise and lifting the ice shelf enough to allow the lake to rapidly drain beneath the glacier toward its edge. This event revealed a mechanism by which natural drainage events can trigger such floods, and why floods from this particular lake are more likely to occur in summer.",Negative,Global stance

_______________

**The future in the past**

A major cause of uncertainties in climate projections is our imprecise knowledge of how much warming should occur as a result of a given increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Paleoclimate records have the potential to help us sharpen that understanding because they record such a wide variety of environmental conditions. Tierney et al. review the recent advances in data collection, statistics, and modeling that might help us better understand how rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide will affect future climate.

**BACKGROUND**

Anthropogenic emissions are rapidly altering Earth’s climate, pushing it toward a warmer state for which there is no historical precedent. Although no perfect analog exists for such a disruption, Earth’s history includes past climate states—“paleoclimates”—that hold lessons for the future of our warming world. These periods in Earth’s past span a tremendous range of temperatures, precipitation patterns, cryospheric extent, and biospheric adaptations and are increasingly relevant for improving our understanding of how key elements of the climate system are affected by greenhouse gas levels. The rise of new geochemical and statistical methods, as well as improvements in paleoclimate modeling, allow for formal evaluation of climate models based on paleoclimate data. In particular, given that some of the newest generation of climate models have a high sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, there is a renewed role for paleoclimates in constraining equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and its dependence on climate background state.

**ADVANCES**

In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have used paleoclimate temperature and CO2 estimates to infer ECS in the deep past, in both warm and cold climate states. Recent studies support the paradigm that ECS is strongly state-dependent, rising with increased CO2 concentrations. Simulations of past warm climates such as the Eocene further highlight the role that cloud feedbacks play in contributing to high ECS under increased CO2 levels. Paleoclimates have provided critical constraints on the assessment of future ice sheet stability and concomitant sea level rise, including the viability of threshold processes like marine ice cliff instability. Beyond global-scale changes, analyses of past changes in the water cycle have advanced our understanding of dynamical drivers of hydroclimate, which is highly relevant for regional climate projections and societal impacts. New and expanding techniques, such as analyses of single shells of foraminifera, are yielding subseasonal climate information that can be used to study how intra- and interannual modes of variability are affected by external climate forcing. Studies of extraordinary, transient departures in paleoclimate from the background state such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum provide critical context for the current anthropogenic aberration, its impact on the Earth system, and the time scale of recovery.

A number of advances have eroded the “language barrier” between climate model and proxy data, facilitating more direct use of paleoclimate information to constrain model performance. It is increasingly common to incorporate geochemical tracers, such as water isotopes, directly into model simulations, and this practice has vastly improved model-proxy comparisons. The development of new statistical approaches rooted in Bayesian inference has led to a more thorough quantification of paleoclimate data uncertainties. In addition, techniques like data assimilation allow for a formal combination of proxy and model data into hybrid products. Such syntheses provide a full-field view of past climates and can put constraints on climate variables that we have no direct proxies for, such as cloud cover or wind speed.

**OUTLOOK**

A common concern with using paleoclimate information as model targets is that non-CO2 forcings, such as aerosols and trace greenhouse gases, are not well known, especially in the distant past. Although evidence thus far suggests that such forcings are secondary to CO2, future improvements in both geochemical proxies and modeling are on track to tackle this issue. New and rapidly evolving geochemical techniques have the potential to provide improved constraints on the terrestrial biosphere, aerosols, and trace gases; likewise, biogeochemical cycles can now be incorporated into paleoclimate model simulations. Beyond constraining forcings, it is critical that proxy information is transformed into quantitative estimates that account for uncertainties in the proxy system. Statistical tools have already been developed to achieve this, which should make it easier to create robust targets for model evaluation. With this increase in quantification of paleoclimate information, we suggest that modeling centers include simulation of past climates in their evaluation and statement of their model performance. This practice is likely to narrow uncertainties surrounding climate sensitivity, ice sheets, and the water cycle and thus improve future climate projections.",Positive,Global stance

No, that would be simplified but accurate.  About 10% is precipitated out of the atmosphere.  Destruction in the stratosphere is significantly reduced by transport limitations which is ""cycling out"" of a sort.

To simplify, NO2 + hf -&gt; NO + O, O + O2 -&gt; O3, O + H2O -&gt; 2OH.  hf is UV light.  Methane breakdown uses OH and converts NO to NO2, which creates ozone.  The effect isn't that large because it's a few molecules only and methane is relatively stable, but it's significant in clean parts of the troposphere.

In the dry stratosphere, the H2O from methane breakdown adds OH which breaks down O3, so the net effect is negative.

_____________________

**Abstract**

The Radiative‐Convective Equilibrium Model Intercomparison Project (RCEMIP) consists of simulations at three fixed sea‐surface temperatures (SSTs: 295, 300, and 305 K) and thus allows for a calculation of the climate feedback parameter based on the change of the top‐of‐atmosphere radiation imbalance. Climate feedback parameters range widely across RCEMIP, roughly from −6 to 3 W m−2 K−1, particularly across general‐circulation models (GCMs) as well as global and large‐domain cloud‐resolving models (CRMs). Small‐domain CRMs and large‐eddy simulations have a smaller range of climate feedback parameters due to the absence of convective self‐aggregation. More than 70–80% of the intermodel spread in the climate feedback parameter can be explained by the combined temperature dependencies of convective aggregation and shallow cloud fraction. Low climate sensitivities are associated with an increase of shallow cloud fraction (increasing the planetary albedo) and/or an increase in convective aggregation with warming. An increase in aggregation is associated with an increase in outgoing longwave radiation, caused primarily by mid‐tropospheric drying, and secondarily by an expansion of subsidence regions. Climate sensitivity is neither dependent on the average amount of aggregation nor on changes in deep/anvil cloud fraction. GCMs have a lower overall climate sensitivity than CRMs because in most GCMs convective aggregation increases with warming, whereas in CRMs, convective aggregation shows no consistent temperature trend.

**Plain Language Summary**

To determine how much Earth will warm in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, we need to understand the atmospheric response to this forcing. The amount of warming in response to a given forcing is called climate sensitivity. Although global climate models are a useful tool to estimate climate sensitivity, estimates remain uncertain, in particular because the response of tropical clouds to warming is uncertain. The weakness of climate models is their coarse grid spacing, with which they cannot resolve important aspects of the weather like clouds and convection. In this study, we use a popular idealization for the tropics, the radiative‐convective equilibrium setup, to compare climate sensitivities across a wide range of models including global climate models and cloud‐resolving models. We find that more than 70–80% of variations in climate sensitivity across these models result from changes in shallow cloud fraction and changes in the spatial organization of convection with warming. Our results indicate that climate sensitivity might be underestimated by global climate models, in which the amount of spatial organization of convection mostly increases with warming, leading to low climate sensitivities, while the cloud‐resolving models show no consistent trend in spatial organization, and thus have higher climate sensitivities.",Positive,Global stance

1. **Ocean heat uptake:** Indeed, if you apply some radiative forcing, such as by increasing the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmospheres (e.g. from human emissions), then about 60% of the resulting warming will occur in the first 10 years while the next 40% will be spread over the next few hundred years. Combining these two effects, about 75% of warming happens after about 30-40 years, which is where your number comes from (Mathematically, the 40 year timescale is the exponential decay scale that comes out of solving the one-box energy balance model ODE, if that means anything to you, and is the ratio of two parameters: the ocean's heat capacity to its deep ocean heat uptake rate).

2. **Natural carbon sinks:** when humans emit fossil CO2, or other greenhouse gases, it throws the carbon cycle out of equilibrium. Pretty quickly, the surface ocean and terrestrial biosphere come back to equilibrium by sucking up some of that CO2 (e.g. by dissolving it in the ocean or by taking it up in soils or plants). Just like for ocean heat uptake, this happens on a number of timescales.

These two processes are thus competing: ocean heat uptake delays some of the warming for later, while CO2 uptake just straight up cancels future warming. It seems to be somewhat of a coincidence that after about 10 years (that /u/DrFolAmour007 is talking about), these two effects pretty much cancel exactly, leading to the fascinating result that: **global warming is directly proportional to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions.**",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

Basically the time lag between the CO2 release and the warming effect is a bit shorter than what you had in memory, it's around 10 years (median time). 

But the confusion comes from the fact that it wasn't always the case. For example, in the past, during a glacial/interglacial period the warming is mostly due to a cycle in the rotation axis of the Earth, that is, the Earth change its axis, receive more energy from the sun, gets warmer... and then, due to other inter-relations then the CO2 increases.

So, in the history of the Earth it's not always the case where CO2 rises first, then Earth gets warmer. But in our current situation it is the case and it is well observed and understood. the CO2 we emit is going to stay in the atmosphere for 1000s of years, and it is going to warm the planet, taking, depending on calculations between 6 to 30 years to have its warming effect.

Even we cut CO2 emissions completely tomorrow, we will still have an increase of Earth's temperatures for at least 10 years before it starts stabilizing. But no matter what we do (unless we have a miraculous breakthrough in carbon capture tech), we won't go back to pre-industrial level temperatures for 1000s of years. With the CO2 that we have already emitted we have exited that long period of climate stability that had allowed human civilizations to rise up. We have to adapt now to climate instability. However, if we keep emitting CO2 (typically if we don't reach zero-carbon by 2050, more or less), then the climate instability will become so strong that we won't be able to adapt to it anymore, the Earth will become vastly uninhabitable with only some refuges in northern countries like Canada, Norway, Greenland...",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

New radiocarbon and sedimentological results from the Gulf of Alaska document recurrent millennial-scale episodes of reorganized Pacific Ocean ventilation synchronous with rapid Cordilleran Ice Sheet discharge, indicating close coupling of ice-ocean dynamics spanning the past 42,000 years. Ventilation of the intermediate-depth North Pacific tracks strength of the Asian Monsoon, supporting a role for moisture and heat transport from low-latitudes in North Pacific paleoclimate. Changes in 14C age of intermediate waters are in phase with peaks in Cordilleran ice-rafted debris delivery, and both consistently precede ice discharge events from the Laurentide Ice Sheet, known as Heinrich Events. This timing precludes an Atlantic trigger for Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreat, and instead implicates the Pacific as an early part of a cascade of dynamic climate events with global impact.",Negative,Global stance

But here is a cool little angle to think about if you do this thought experiment in class.

Our atmospheric carbon increase is significantly controlled by the amount of carbon the ocean absorbs.

So, for example, if we emit 100 units of CO2 into the atmosphere, the ocean absorbs some part of it (say 20 units) and the rest gets accumulated in the atmosphere. One of the assumptions of future climate change scenarios is that the ocean intake of CO2 will be proportional to how much CO2 we emit into the atmosphere. But recent studies have shown that the oceans change their CO2 absorption behavior according to the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. So, burning all your plastic at once wouldn't directly increase the atmospheric CO2 by a proportional amount. It will change how the oceans absorb that CO2 and what effect that has on ocean acidification and further chain reactions.

**Abstract**

Seawater generally forms stratified layers with lighter waters near the surface and denser waters at greater depth. This stable configuration acts as a barrier to water mixing that impacts the efficiency of vertical exchanges of heat, carbon, oxygen and other constituents. Previous quantification of stratification change has been limited to simple differencing of surface and 200-m depth changes and has neglected the spatial complexity of ocean density change. Here, we quantify changes in ocean stratification down to depths of 2,000 m using the squared buoyancy frequency N2 and newly available ocean temperature/salinity observations. We find that stratification globally has increased by a substantial 5.3% [5.0%, 5.8%] in recent decades (1960–2018) (the confidence interval is 5–95%); a rate of 0.90% per decade. Most of the increase (~71%) occurred in the upper 200 m of the ocean and resulted largely (&gt;90%) from temperature changes, although salinity changes play an important role locally.",Positive,Global stance

The current cow population in North America is around 100 million animals - but estimates of the bison population in 1500 are between 30 and 60 million animals.  Americans could certainly get by eating 1/3 as much meat as they do today, too.

Second, methane is currently at 2 .5 times preindustrial atmospheric levels, so it is a concern, but there’s a big difference between methane coming from fracking (fossil methane) and the cow/rice paddy methane, in that cow/rice paddy methane was recently atmospheric CO2 (taken up by plants, broken down to methane, and then that methane is oxidized in the atmosphere back to CO2, a process that takes ~10 yrs).  Permafrost methane is somewhere in between (this is from carbon that was stored in permafrost tens of thousands of years ago, and is now leaking back into the atmosphere due to arctic warming).

Then you have to worry about methane stored in shallow arctic sediments as methane hydrate, a kind of deepwater frozen methane ice. If the oceans warm significantly much of that could be released to the atmosphere, causing a massive spike in warming and atmospheric methane. 

As far as policy? Yes eating less meat and reducing the cow population to 1500s-era levels would be great, but getting off fossil fuels is more important, but unfortunately permafrost melting and ocean warming seems set to continue for the rest of our lifetimes.

**Abstract**

The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), one of the best studied palaeoclimatic intervals, offers an excellent opportunity to investigate how the climate system responds to changes in greenhouse gases and the cryosphere. Previous work has sought to constrain the magnitude and pattern of glacial cooling from palaeothermometers, but the uneven distribution of the proxies, as well as their uncertainties, has challenged the construction of a full-field view of the LGM climate state. Here we combine a large collection of geochemical proxies for sea surface temperature with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to produce a field reconstruction of LGM temperatures using data assimilation. The reconstruction is validated with withheld proxies as well as independent ice core and speleothem δ18O measurements. Our assimilated product provides a constraint on global mean LGM cooling of −6.1 degrees Celsius (95 per cent confidence interval: −6.5 to −5.7 degrees Celsius). Given assumptions concerning the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, ice sheets and mineral dust aerosols, this cooling translates to an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.4 degrees Celsius (2.4–4.5 degrees Celsius), a value that is higher than previous LGM-based estimates but consistent with the traditional consensus range of 2–4.5 degrees Celsius.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

,2020,9,"The Greenland ice sheet owes its existence to the growth of an arc of islands in Southeast Asia — stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea — over the last 15 million years, a new study claims.","Study: [Emergence of the Southeast Asian islands as a driver for Neogene cooling](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/09/23/2011033117)
________________

**Significance**

The Southeast Asian islands are a modern-day hotspot of CO2 consumption via silicate weathering. Since ∼15 million years ago, these islands have been increasing in size at the same time that Earth’s climate has been cooling. Here, we test the hypothesis that this global cooling could have been driven by tectonic emergence of the Southeast Asian islands. Using a compilation of paleoshorelines, in conjunction with a coupled silicate weathering and climate model, we find that this emergence is associated with a large decrease in pCO2. Without these changes in tropical island paleogeography, there would not have been large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets as a defining feature of Earth’s climate over the past 3 million years.

**Abstract**

Steep topography, a tropical climate, and mafic lithologies contribute to efficient chemical weathering and carbon sequestration in the Southeast Asian islands. Ongoing arc–continent collision between the Sunda-Banda arc system and Australia has increased the area of subaerially exposed land in the region since the mid-Miocene. Concurrently, Earth’s climate has cooled since the Miocene Climatic Optimum, leading to growth of the Antarctic ice sheet and the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. We seek to evaluate the hypothesis that the emergence of the Southeast Asian islands played a significant role in driving this cooling trend through increasing global weatherability. To do so, we have compiled paleoshoreline data and incorporated them into GEOCLIM, which couples a global climate model to a silicate weathering model with spatially resolved lithology. We find that without the increase in area of the Southeast Asian islands over the Neogene, atmospheric pCO2 would have been significantly higher than preindustrial values, remaining above the levels necessary for initiating Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.",Positive,Undefined

__________________

**The heat is on**

Anthropogenic climate change is causing not only more episodes of historically high air temperatures but also more frequent spells of unusually increased ocean temperatures. Marine heatwaves, defined as periods of anonymously high regional surface ocean temperatures, have also become common in recent decades. Laufkötter et al. show that the frequency of these events has already increased more than 10-fold because of anthropogenic global warming, making marine heatwaves, which typically occurred once in hundreds to thousands of years in preindustrial times, likely to occur on an annual to decadal basis if the global average air temperature rises by 3°C.

**Abstract**

Marine heatwaves (MHWs)—periods of extremely high ocean temperatures in specific regions—have occurred in all of Earth’s ocean basins over the past two decades, with severe negative impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems. However, for most individual MHWs, it is unclear to what extent they have been altered by human-induced climate change. We show that the occurrence probabilities of the duration, intensity, and cumulative intensity of most documented, large, and impactful MHWs have increased more than 20-fold as a result of anthropogenic climate change. MHWs that occurred only once every hundreds to thousands of years in the preindustrial climate are projected to become decadal to centennial events under 1.5°C warming conditions and annual to decadal events under 3°C warming conditions. Thus, ambitious climate targets are indispensable to reduce the risks of substantial MHW impacts.",Positive,Weather extremes

**Abstract**

More than half of Earth’s freshwater resources are held by the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which thus represents by far the largest potential source for global sea-level rise under future warming conditions. Its long-term stability determines the fate of our coastal cities and cultural heritage. Feedbacks between ice, atmosphere, ocean, and the solid Earth give rise to potential nonlinearities in its response to temperature changes. So far, we are lacking a comprehensive stability analysis of the Antarctic Ice Sheet for different amounts of global warming. Here we show that the Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits a multitude of temperature thresholds beyond which ice loss is irreversible. Consistent with palaeodata we find, using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, that at global warming levels around 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, West Antarctica is committed to long-term partial collapse owing to the marine ice-sheet instability. Between 6 and 9 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the loss of more than 70 per cent of the present-day ice volume is triggered, mainly caused by the surface elevation feedback. At more than 10 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, Antarctica is committed to become virtually ice-free. The ice sheet’s temperature sensitivity is 1.3 metres of sea-level equivalent per degree of warming up to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, almost doubling to 2.4 metres per degree of warming between 2 and 6 degrees and increasing to about 10 metres per degree of warming between 6 and 9 degrees. Each of these thresholds gives rise to hysteresis behaviour: that is, the currently observed ice-sheet configuration is not regained even if temperatures are reversed to present-day levels. In particular, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet does not regrow to its modern extent until temperatures are at least one degree Celsius lower than pre-industrial levels. Our results show that if the Paris Agreement is not met, Antarctica’s long-term sea-level contribution will dramatically increase and exceed that of all other sources.",Positive,Global stance

**Hearing the heat**

Most of the excess heat that causes global warming is absorbed by the oceans. Quantifying that heat increase is challenging because it requires many different temperature measurements over both the vertical and horizontal extent of the oceans. Wu et al. report success in this effort through the use of a different method: They inferred temperature changes from sound waves generated by repeating earthquakes (see the Perspective by Wunsch). The travel time of these earthquakes from source to receiver reflects changes in the average water temperature that they encounter. This technique should substantially enhance our ability to monitor ocean warming.

**Abstract**

More than 90% of the energy trapped on Earth by increasingly abundant greenhouse gases is absorbed by the ocean. Monitoring the resulting ocean warming remains a challenging sampling problem. To complement existing point measurements, we introduce a method that infers basin-scale deep-ocean temperature changes from the travel times of sound waves that are generated by repeating earthquakes. A first implementation of this seismic ocean thermometry constrains temperature anomalies averaged across a 3000-kilometer-long section in the equatorial East Indian Ocean with a standard error of 0.0060 kelvin. Between 2005 and 2016, we find temperature fluctuations on time scales of 12 months, 6 months, and ~10 days, and we infer a decadal warming trend that substantially exceeds previous estimates.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

The Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global mean sea-level rise today and is expected to continue to lose mass as the Arctic continues to warm. The two predominant mass loss mechanisms are increased surface meltwater run-off and mass loss associated with the retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. In this paper we use a large ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models forced by output from a representative subset of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) global climate models to project ice sheet changes and sea-level rise contributions over the 21st century. The simulations are part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). We estimate the sea-level contribution together with uncertainties due to future climate forcing, ice sheet model formulations and ocean forcing for the two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. The results indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass in both scenarios until 2100, with contributions of 90±50 and 32±17 mm to sea-level rise for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The largest mass loss is expected from the south-west of Greenland, which is governed by surface mass balance changes, continuing what is already observed today. Because the contributions are calculated against an unforced control experiment, these numbers do not include any committed mass loss, i.e. mass loss that would occur over the coming century if the climate forcing remained constant. Under RCP8.5 forcing, ice sheet model uncertainty explains an ensemble spread of 40 mm, while climate model uncertainty and ocean forcing uncertainty account for a spread of 36 and 19 mm, respectively. Apart from those formally derived uncertainty ranges, the largest gap in our knowledge is about the physical understanding and implementation of the calving process, i.e. the interaction of the ice sheet with the ocean.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is an active component of the Earth’s climate system1 and its response to global warming is of critical importance to society. Climate models have shown an AMOC slowdown under anthropogenic warming since the industrial revolution, but this slowdown has been difficult to detect in the short observational record because of substantial interdecadal climate variability. This has led to the indirect detection of the slowdown from longer-term fingerprints such as the subpolar North Atlantic ‘warming hole’. However, these fingerprints, which exhibit some uncertainties, are all local indicators of AMOC slowdown around the subpolar North Atlantic. Here we show observational and modelling evidence of a remote indicator of AMOC slowdown outside the North Atlantic. Under global warming, the weakening AMOC reduces the salinity divergence and then leads to a ‘salinity pile-up’ remotely in the South Atlantic. This evidence is consistent with the AMOC slowdown under anthropogenic warming and, furthermore, suggests that this weakening has likely occurred all the way into the South Atlantic.",Negative,Undefined

**Abstract**

The Florida Current marks the beginning of the Gulf Stream at Florida Straits, and plays an important role in climate. Nearly continuous measurements of Florida Current transport are available at 27°N since 1982. These data are too short for assessing possible multidecadal or centennial trends. Here I reconstruct Florida Current transport during 1909–2018 using probabilistic methods and principles of ocean physics applied to the available transport data and longer coastal sea-level records. Florida Current transport likely declined steadily during the past century. Transport since 1982 has likely been weaker on average than during 1909–1981. The weakest decadal-mean transport in the last 110 y likely took place in the past two decades. Results corroborate hypotheses that the deep branch of the overturning circulation declined over the recent past, and support relationships observed in climate models between the overturning and surface western boundary current transports at multidecadal and longer timescales.",Negative,Undefined

**Abstract**

here is mounting evidence of species redistribution as climate warms. Yet, our knowledge of the coupling between species range shifts and isotherm shifts remains limited. Here, we introduce BioShifts—a global geo-database of 30,534 range shifts. Despite a spatial imbalance towards the most developed regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a taxonomic bias towards the most charismatic animals and plants of the planet, data show that marine species are better at tracking isotherm shifts, and move towards the pole six times faster than terrestrial species. More specifically, we find that marine species closely track shifting isotherms in warm and relatively undisturbed waters (for example, the Central Pacific Basin) or in cold waters subject to high human pressures (for example, the North Sea). On land, human activities impede the capacity of terrestrial species to track isotherm shifts in latitude, with some species shifting in the opposite direction to isotherms. Along elevational gradients, species follow the direction of isotherm shifts but at a pace that is much slower than expected, especially in areas with warm climates. Our results suggest that terrestrial species are lagging behind shifting isotherms more than marine species, which is probably related to the interplay between the wider thermal safety margin of terrestrial versus marine species and the more constrained physical environment for dispersal in terrestrial versus marine habitats.",Positive,Global stance

**Significance**

Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are among the fastest changing outlet glaciers in Antarctica. Yet, projecting the future of these glaciers remains a major uncertainty for sea level rise. Here we use satellite imagery to show the development of damage areas with crevasses and open fractures on Pine Island and Thwaites ice shelves. These damage areas are first signs of their structural weakening as they precondition these ice shelves for disintegration. Model results that include the damage mechanism highlight the importance of damage for ice shelf stability, grounding line retreat, and future sea level contributions from Antarctica. Moreover, they underline the need for incorporating damage processes in models to improve sea level rise projections.

**Abstract**

Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are among the fastest changing outlet glaciers in West Antarctica with large consequences for global sea level. Yet, assessing how much and how fast both glaciers will weaken if these changes continue remains a major uncertainty as many of the processes that control their ice shelf weakening and grounding line retreat are not well understood. Here, we combine multisource satellite imagery with modeling to uncover the rapid development of damage areas in the shear zones of Pine Island and Thwaites ice shelves. These damage areas consist of highly crevassed areas and open fractures and are first signs that the shear zones of both ice shelves have structurally weakened over the past decade. Idealized model results reveal moreover that the damage initiates a feedback process where initial ice shelf weakening triggers the development of damage in their shear zones, which results in further speedup, shearing, and weakening, hence promoting additional damage development. This damage feedback potentially preconditions these ice shelves for disintegration and enhances grounding line retreat. The results of this study suggest that damage feedback processes are key to future ice shelf stability, grounding line retreat, and sea level contributions from Antarctica. Moreover, they underline the need for incorporating these feedback processes, which are currently not accounted for in most ice sheet models, to improve sea level rise projections.",Positive,Undefined

____________

**Significance**

During the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) (56 Mya), the planet warmed by 5 to 8 °C, deep-sea organisms went extinct, and the oceans rapidly acidified. Geochemical records from fossil shells of a group of plankton called foraminifera record how much ocean pH decreased during the PETM. Here, we apply a geochemical indicator, the B/Ca content of foraminifera, to reconstruct the amount and makeup of the carbon added to the ocean. Our reconstruction invokes volcanic emissions as a driver of PETM warming and suggests that the buffering capacity of the ocean increased, which helped to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, our estimates confirm that modern CO2 release is occurring much faster than PETM carbon release.

**Abstract**

The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) (55.6 Mya) was a geologically rapid carbon-release event that is considered the closest natural analog to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Recent work has used boron-based proxies in planktic foraminifera to characterize the extent of surface-ocean acidification that occurred during the event. However, seawater acidity alone provides an incomplete constraint on the nature and source of carbon release. Here, we apply previously undescribed culture calibrations for the B/Ca proxy in planktic foraminifera and use them to calculate relative changes in seawater-dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, surmising that Pacific surface-ocean DIC increased by +1,010 (+1,415/−646) µmol/kg during the peak-PETM. Making reasonable assumptions for the pre-PETM oceanic DIC inventory, we provide a fully data-driven estimate of the PETM carbon source. Our reconstruction yields a mean source carbon δ13C of −10‰ and a mean increase in the oceanic C inventory of +14,900 petagrams of carbon (PgC), pointing to volcanic CO2 emissions as the main carbon source responsible for PETM warming.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**The states of past climate**

Deep-sea benthic foraminifera preserve an essential record of Earth's past climate in their oxygen- and carbon-isotope compositions. However, this record lacks sufficient temporal resolution and/or age control in some places to determine which climate forcing and feedback mechanisms were most important. Westerhold et al. present a highly resolved and well-dated record of benthic carbon and oxygen isotopes for the past 66 million years. Their reconstruction and analysis show that Earth's climate can be grouped into discrete states separated by transitions related to changing greenhouse gas levels and the growth of polar ice sheets. Each climate state is paced by orbital cycles but responds to variations in radiative forcing in a state-dependent manner.

**Abstract**

Much of our understanding of Earth’s past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate states of the Cenozoic era and to study their dynamics. Here, we present a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four climate states—Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse—are identified on the basis of their distinctive response to astronomical forcing depending on greenhouse gas concentrations and polar ice sheet volume. Statistical analysis of the nonlinear behavior encoded in our record reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.

_____________

**Abstract**

Despite recent advances, the link between the evolution of atmospheric CO2 and climate during the Eocene greenhouse remains uncertain. In particular, modelling studies suggest that in order to achieve the global warmth that characterised the early Eocene, warmer climates must be more sensitive to CO2 forcing than colder climates. Here, we test this assertion in the geological record by combining a new high-resolution boron isotope-based CO2 record with novel estimates of Global Mean Temperature. We find that Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) was indeed higher during the warmest intervals of the Eocene, agreeing well with recent model simulations, and declined through the Eocene as global climate cooled. These observations indicate that the canonical IPCC range of ECS (1.5 to 4.5 °C per doubling) is unlikely to be appropriate for high-CO2 warm climates of the past, and the state dependency of ECS may play an increasingly important role in determining the state of future climate as the Earth continues to warm.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Glacial lakes are rapidly growing in response to climate change and glacier retreat. The role of these lakes as terrestrial storage for glacial meltwater is currently unknown and not accounted for in global sea level assessments. Here, we map glacier lakes around the world using 254,795 satellite images and use scaling relations to estimate that global glacier lake volume increased by around 48%, to 156.5 km^(3), between 1990 and 2018. This methodology provides a near-global database and analysis of glacial lake extent, volume and change. Over the study period, lake numbers and total area increased by 53 and 51%, respectively. Median lake size has increased 3%; however, the 95th percentile has increased by around 9%. Currently, glacial lakes hold about 0.43 mm of sea level equivalent. As glaciers continue to retreat and feed glacial lakes, the implications for glacial lake outburst floods and water resources are of considerable societal and ecological importance.",Negative,Global stance

How much interfacing is required with the model code itself will depend on the exact model you're using, but it's likely that little to no knowledge of Fortran will be needed.

That's a lot of questions you're asking!

Using a climate model and analysing the results involves different steps that require different coding skills.

First of all, you work with a model that is more suitable for use on a supercomputer (so yes, you can ofc work remotely). The best solution would be to ask if you can access a supercomputer from the Max Planck Institute (e.g. Blizzard in DKRZ) or another one where the model is already installed. Ask your supervisor. If you do not have access to one, you should port this model to one of the supercomputers at your university or institute. This step can be tricky, especially if you don't have the support of someone from the MPI. You will need to have a good knowledge of Linux and Bash/shell systems. If you can do this, you will be able to run the model in its basic settings and be able to modify some of its parameterization (probably not enough to do sensitivity experiments, however, it depends on the model). Read the user guide.

Then, if you want to do sensitivity experiments, you will probably have to modify one or two subroutines of the model written in Fortran. So have some Fortran skills. Although this will not be the most difficult part, you may need the help of someone who knows how the model works.

Thirdly, you need to clean up and analyse the output of your model (in files called netCDF). If you have a lot of runs, I recommend you use either Python or softwares like Ferret (easier to use but the maps and plots look terrible). You may also find help in the user guide.

As you can see, I strongly recommend that you include in your committee a member of the MPI or someone from your university who has already used ECHAM.

**All together then**

Many geographically dispersed records from across the globe reveal the occurrence of abrupt climate changes, called interstadial events, during the last glacial period. These events appear to have happened at the same time, but the difficulty of determining absolute dates in many of the records have made that proposition difficult to prove. Corrick et al. present results from 63 precisely dated speleothems that confirm the synchrony of those interstadial events. Their results also provide a tool with which to validate model simulations of abrupt climate change and calibrate other time series such as ice-core chronologies.

**Abstract**

Abrupt climate changes during the last glacial period have been detected in a global array of palaeoclimate records, but our understanding of their absolute timing and regional synchrony is incomplete. Our compilation of 63 published, independently dated speleothem records shows that abrupt warmings in Greenland were associated with synchronous climate changes across the Asian Monsoon, South American Monsoon, and European-Mediterranean regions that occurred within decades. Together with the demonstration of bipolar synchrony in atmospheric response, this provides independent evidence of synchronous high-latitude–to-tropical coupling of climate changes during these abrupt warmings. Our results provide a globally coherent framework with which to validate model simulations of abrupt climate change and to constrain ice-core chronologies.",Positive,Undefined

________________________

**Abstract**

The rate of global-mean sea-level rise since 1900 has varied over time, but the contributing factors are still poorly understood1. Previous assessments found that the summed contributions of ice-mass loss, terrestrial water storage and thermal expansion of the ocean could not be reconciled with observed changes in global-mean sea level, implying that changes in sea level or some contributions to those changes were poorly constrained2,3. Recent improvements to observational data, our understanding of the main contributing processes to sea-level change and methods for estimating the individual contributions, mean another attempt at reconciliation is warranted. Here we present a probabilistic framework to reconstruct sea level since 1900 using independent observations and their inherent uncertainties. The sum of the contributions to sea-level change from thermal expansion of the ocean, ice-mass loss and changes in terrestrial water storage is consistent with the trends and multidecadal variability in observed sea level on both global and basin scales, which we reconstruct from tide-gauge records. Ice-mass loss—predominantly from glaciers—has caused twice as much sea-level rise since 1900 as has thermal expansion. Mass loss from glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet explains the high rates of global sea-level rise during the 1940s, while a sharp increase in water impoundment by artificial reservoirs is the main cause of the lower-than-average rates during the 1970s. The acceleration in sea-level rise since the 1970s is caused by the combination of thermal expansion of the ocean and increased ice-mass loss from Greenland. Our results reconcile the magnitude of observed global-mean sea-level rise since 1900 with estimates based on the underlying processes, implying that no additional processes are required to explain the observed changes in sea level since 1900.",Negative,Undefined

_________________

**Abstract**

Severe landfall typhoons (SLTYs), defined as those with maximum sustained wind speed ≥41.5 m s−1 at landfalls, strongly affect the coastal regions of China and cause grave losses of life and property. In this study, we analyse the SLTYs in China in peak summer (July–September) for the period of 1973–2017, during which typhoon landfall intensity (LFI) experienced significantly abrupt strengthening in 1987 and 2003. The period is divided into three sub-periods: period-I (1973–1987), period-II (1988–2003), and period-III (2004–2017). It is found that the increase in LFI is dominated by the enhancement of intensification rate but not intensification duration. Meanwhile, the SLTYs in China have also abruptly increased since 2004, characterized by the count of about 65.9% (72.7%) of SLTYs in China (South China) in period-III. Further analysis shows that the warming subsurface ocean heat content (OHC) over the northern South China Sea (SCS) plays a key role in modulating typhoon's intensification, which subsequently enhances the easterly steering flow leading typhoons to move westward. Low-level water vapour convergence and vorticity are enhanced accompanied by warming northern SCS along the coastal region of southeastern China, resulting rapid typhoon intensification before landfall.About 9.7% of typhoons with landfall in South China experienced a rapid intensification process in 24 hr before landfalls in period-III. However, the per-centage is only 1.6 and 3.1% for period-I and period-II, respectively. The warming land surface over South China plays a minor role in attracting typhoons to landfall in South China, which named as “warmward landfall” .Overall, the abrupt enhancement of LFI and more SLTYs in China since 2004 are governed by the warming ocean, while the abnormal easterly steering flow and warming land surface over South China leading typhoons to move west-ward play a secondary role.",Positive,Weather extremes

**Abstract**


Theory and observation suggest that Earth and Earth-like planets can undergo runaway low-latitude glaciation when changes in solar heating or in the carbon cycle exceed a critical threshold. Here, we use a simple dynamical-system representation of the ice–albedo feedback and the carbonate–silicate cycle to show that glaciation is also triggered when solar heating changes faster than a critical rate. Such ‘rate-induced glaciations’ remain accessible far from the outer edge of the habitable zone, because the warm climate state retains long-term stability. In contrast, glaciations induced by changes in the carbon cycle require the warm climate state to become unstable, constraining the kinds of perturbations that could have caused global glaciation in Earth’s past. We show that glaciations can occur when Earth’s climate transitions between two warm stable states; this property of the Earth system could help explain why major events in the development of life have been accompanied by glaciations.",Positive,Global stance

If you ask me about my feelings, I will say , in personal opinion, it is good to be optimistic about these sequestration projects. And being optimistic is a way better deal. 

But, if you ask me for a scientific opinion, here are my thoughts:

First, sequestering GHG is an old idea, I remember a number of companies working before and now, some are on brink of failure , because of funding or inconceivable issues. Not that , that may be good or bad, but the market-industrial  relevance is unacceptable.



Second, sequestration is possible in many number of ways, from bio-sequestration to chemical and physical. Since this project vesta falls primarily on the physical (geological) category, I would ask the cost to GHG emissions ratio... in simple words, transportation of minerals in ore or conc. form is not a easy feat....

Thirdly, there is a geological issue too, it seems , olivine has certainly other characteristics which impacts the local geological environment in ways difficult to observe .... 

Fourth: You mentioned they are claiming, but  consider the feasibility of this project : Coastlines to be reengineered, transportation, mining, etc. 
Personally, I like these claims, even if they are too optimistic, I believe they are in trying for a different path.  Claims are always hard to get by, especially in geo engineering context. 

There have been many breakthroughs in sequestration lately, none of which since the last 2 decades have been successful... 

Note: I am not trying to be against them, it is rather impossible for a scientist to be against them . And I have briefly gone through their website and the conf. Paper. So others after me , may find me wrong or right.

_________________

**Abstract**

The Last Interglacial (LIG), a warmer period 130,000–116,000 years before present, is a potential analogue for future climate change. Stronger LIG summertime insolation at high northern latitudes drove Arctic land summer temperatures 4–5 °C higher than in the pre-industrial era. Climate model simulations have previously failed to capture these elevated temperatures, possibly because they were unable to correctly capture LIG sea-ice changes. Here, we show that the latest version of the fully coupled UK Hadley Center climate model (HadGEM3) simulates a more accurate Arctic LIG climate, including elevated temperatures. Improved model physics, including a sophisticated sea-ice melt-pond scheme, result in a complete simulated loss of Arctic sea ice in summer during the LIG, which has yet to be simulated in past generations of models. This ice-free Arctic yields a compelling solution to the long-standing puzzle of what drove LIG Arctic warmth and supports a fast retreat of future Arctic summer sea ice.",Positive,Undefined

_________________

**Significance**

Over many millennia, northern peatlands have accumulated large amounts of carbon and nitrogen, thus cooling the global climate. Over shorter timescales, peatland disturbances can trigger losses of peat and release of greenhouses gases. Despite their importance to the global climate, peatlands remain poorly mapped, and the vulnerability of permafrost peatlands to warming is uncertain. This study compiles over 7,000 field observations to present a data-driven map of northern peatlands and their carbon and nitrogen stocks. We use these maps to model the impact of permafrost thaw on peatlands and find that warming will likely shift the greenhouse gas balance of northern peatlands. At present, peatlands cool the climate, but anthropogenic warming can shift them into a net source of warming.

**Abstract**

Northern peatlands have accumulated large stocks of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but their spatial distribution and vulnerability to climate warming remain uncertain. Here, we used machine-learning techniques with extensive peat core data (n &gt; 7,000) to create observation-based maps of northern peatland C and N stocks, and to assess their response to warming and permafrost thaw. We estimate that northern peatlands cover 3.7 ± 0.5 million km2 and store 415 ± 150 Pg C and 10 ± 7 Pg N. Nearly half of the peatland area and peat C stocks are permafrost affected. Using modeled global warming stabilization scenarios (from 1.5 to 6 °C warming), we project that the current sink of atmospheric C (0.10 ± 0.02 Pg C⋅y−1) in northern peatlands will shift to a C source as 0.8 to 1.9 million km2 of permafrost-affected peatlands thaw. The projected thaw would cause peatland greenhouse gas emissions equal to ∼1% of anthropogenic radiative forcing in this century. The main forcing is from methane emissions (0.7 to 3 Pg cumulative CH4-C) with smaller carbon dioxide forcing (1 to 2 Pg CO2-C) and minor nitrous oxide losses. We project that initial CO2-C losses reverse after ∼200 y, as warming strengthens peatland C-sinks. We project substantial, but highly uncertain, additional losses of peat into fluvial systems of 10 to 30 Pg C and 0.4 to 0.9 Pg N. The combined gaseous and fluvial peatland C loss estimated here adds 30 to 50% onto previous estimates of permafrost-thaw C losses, with southern permafrost regions being the most vulnerable.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

I asked a similar question in r/surfing a couple of months ago:

How will the pole‘s ice melting affect the low pressure systems, known in the surfing world as ground swell( huge storms traveling between 30 degrees latitude and 60 degrees latitude),especially in the northern hemisphere?

With the ice of the poles melting, the temperature difference between the poles and the mid lattitudes in the air will likely decrease. This will in turn produce less big storms in Winter, which will ultimately produce less ground swell all around the world, but in particular in the northern hemisphere. Here the ice is melting first. 

That’s what i think could be happening. I read articles that stated storms will get more extreme. But i think that is only true for tropical storms. 

What do you think?
How will this affect the waves and Surf all over the world? In particular Europe and Northern America ? Do you agree with my hypothesis?

"Recent [estimations](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/climate-change-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity-global-warming/) of climate sensitivity imply that the steady state temperature increase from a doubling of C02 above pre-industrial levels (560 PPM) is between 2.6C and 4.1C.  This is a similar although narrower estimate than other mainstream estimates.

I came across this [paper](http://www.highstand.org/erohling/Rohling-papers/2009-Rohling%20et%20al%20AAtemp-sealevel%20ngeo557.pdf) which looks at the relationship between global C02 and temperature from antarctic ice core data.  This [figure](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) from the paper plots C02 vs Temperature, and draws a trend line which intersects with 387 ppm C02.  The Temperature of this intersection is 16C above anthropogenic levels.  This [paper](http://www.globalcoral.org/_oldgcra/AOSIS%20Briefing%202009.pdf#page=6) references the figure and re-affirms the implication, mentioning that it will take thousands of years to reach this steady state.  The original paper mentions that one explanation for the difference of models with lower estimates is that the trend line could curve upward (like the low, middle, and high lines in green) rather than be straight, but even if that were the case, it seems extremely unlikely that, based on the ice core data, a C02 level of 560 ppm would lead to anywhere near as low as 2.6-4.1C.

The most recent period with C02 levels near present day of \~400 ppm was the [mid-pliocene](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/13288), which had ""a mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8 °C to 3.6 °C warmer than preindustrial temperatures"".  How did 400 ppm yield a much lower temperature than implied by the [chart](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) of ice core data, especially considering the ice core chart has data points of 3-4C with C02 less than 300 ppm?  Even if the Mid-pliocene data gives a more accurate climate sensitivity, it seems it would be a much higher sensitivity than what present day mainstream modelers are suggesting, i.e. mid-pliocene implies 560 ppm would lead to higher temps than 2.6-4.1C.  

TLDR: Why is the climate sensitivity in mainstream models different (lower) than what geological ice core data suggests?",2020,8,Climate sensitivity based on models vs ice core data,"I can't speak much to the subtle differences between our modern climate and the past, but me and my all-knowing armchair say that climatologists need more data to constrain modern climate sensitivity estimates.  They keep saying that we remain in an untenable position--particularly in regard to oceans and cloud cover.

Despite large-scale efforts to understand our oceans, like the Argo Program, models still underestimated sea level rise because of factors which weren't well represented in the data (mostly concerning melting land ice from what I remember), and we still don't have the kind of accurate, long-term global cloud cover data that's needed to determine conclusively what kind of effects clouds are having--just some crappy data from a handful of weather satellites and such.

Here, you've cited a paper which incorporates Antarctic ice cores to suggest that the reality of sea level rise over a millennial timescale might be 3-4 times higher than contemporary projections.  Another thread here linked a paper about the [Arctic](https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0860-7#Sec9), which cited examples of previous warming and suggested a mechanism by which the modern recession of sea ice could dramatically increase, casting doubt on the current modeling of the Arctic due to poor representation of that mechanism.

The most recent period with C02 levels near present day of \~400 ppm was the [mid-pliocene](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/13288), which had ""a mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8 °C to 3.6 °C warmer than preindustrial temperatures"".

TLDR: Why is the climate sensitivity in mainstream models different (lower) than what geological ice core data suggests?",2020,8,Climate sensitivity based on models vs ice core data,"Interesting, I hadn't seen it presented that way before.

The paper talks about the discrepancy: 

*""The various scenarios illustrated inFig. 2 highlight an apparent discrepancy between model-based1TAA:[CO2]projections and the natural data (Fig. 2a). Partly, this may arise because the natural relationship may not stay linear with increasing[CO2],but change into an upward curve similar to the model results.As yet, however, this remains unconstrained. Another part of the discrepancy may be addressed from the observation that the high-climate-sensitivity model scenario comes closest to thenatural1TAA:[CO2]relationship (Fig. 2a). The upper limit of climate sensitivity remains elusive [28], and our results strongly corroborate previous suggestions that climate sensitivity may be considerably underestimated where equilibration over millennial time scales is concerned [6,7,29]. Finally, caution is needed when projecting the empirical natural relationships of Fig. 2 into the future, because they rely on natural (near-)equilibrium CO2 values, whereas future projections need to account also for..."" etc.*

In short, we're driving the CO2 levels higher and faster than ever before, and it's hard to constrain the temperature anomaly rate or equilibrium point. Models are the best crystal ball we've got for this situation, and the models point to a decreasing response to increasing amounts of CO2.

The relationship between CO2 and temperature is reasonably expected to be non-linear due to the already near-saturation of IR absorption from CO2, leading to a decreasing *rate* of temperature increase even for dramatic increases in CO2 concentration.

TLDR: Basically, at lower CO2 concentrations, the Earth's temperature appears to warm linearly with increasing concentrations. With even more CO2 we start maxing-out the atmospheric absorption of IR, and any additional CO2 has less and less effect, leading to smaller (non-linear) temperature increases.",Positive,Undefined

Excellent question that has bothered me for many decades. Why? Because an increase of just 100ppm CO2 (180-280ppm), from the peak of the last glacial maximum \~20,000 years ago to the ""climate optimum"" reached about ten-thousand years ago, produced a temperature rise of \~5-degree C.  We have now increased it by an additional 135ppm (280-415ppm). So, where is the heat? Delayed? Poor isotope proxy choices for temps?

"Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases emissions produced by an individual, event or a product. Greenhouse gases include gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases which trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the warming of the earth and in turn global warming.  By reducing the carbon footprint, you can do your part to protect the limited resources on earth. Listed below are some simple changes that you can incorporate in your lifestyle to reduce carbon footprint.

**1.** **Travel Mindfully**

One of the activities that emit the most greenhouse gases is travelling. The most effective way to reduce carbon footprint would be to consider how much and how often we travel.

· **Drive less:**  Try using public transports like buses, metros as frequently as possible. For shorter distance prefer walking or cycling over fuel-powered vehicles.

· **Regularly service your car** to maintain its fuel efficiency.

· **Check tyres:** Low tyre pressure would increase your fuel consumption.

· **Avoid air conditioning** in car as much as possible.

· **Carpooling** your way to the office or other places would drastically reduce the emissions.

· **Fly less**

**2.** **Watch what you eat**

Another mass producer of greenhouse emissions is the food industry.

· **Reduce meat consumption:** Experts say that having a vegan diet is the best for the environment. Avoiding meat (especially red meat) would help in reducing your carbon footprint. The reason behind this is that for the production of red meat a lot of feed, water and land is required. Cows also give off methane emission. A vegetarian or a pescetarian diet is also better for the environment as compared to a diet that contains a lot of meat.

· Buy **locally sourced, organic and plant-based unprocessed foods** from local farmers.  Doing this would reduce your carbon footprint but switching your meat with at least one vegetarian meal a week would be more effective.

· **Minimize food wastage:** Plan meals before-hand to avoid wastage and use the leftovers rather than throwing them away. Check stock availability at home before going for grocery shopping. You can also reduce your food wastage by taking home your leftovers from a restaurant.

**3.** **Changes at home**

Some simple changes at your home will also help in reducing your carbon footprint.

· **Buy energy-efficient space heating/cooling and water heating appliances**. When buying the appliances, always check for the energy star rating.

· Turn off the lights and other appliances when not in use. To save even more energy, turn off the appliances from the power outlet.

· **Switch to LED** lights as they use less energy, last longer and are cheaper as compared to incandescent lights.

· Opt for appliances that use renewable resources, like a solar water heater.

· Get indoor plants in your living space

· Have separate bins for dry and wet waste.

· Buy products with recyclable or minimal packaging.

· Before putting a container in a recycling bin, make sure to empty and rinse the container.

· Recycle paper.

· Recycle tins made out of paper, steel and tin.

· **Compost** your food waste.

· **Reduce water usage** by using low flow faucets and showers. Using water-efficient appliances like washing machines and dishwashers would also be helpful.

· Before throwing away anything, always check if you can **repair or re-use** them.

· Donate working electronics and recycle the broken ones.",2020,6,Easy Lifestyle Changes To Reduce Your Carbon Footprint,"Thanks, that was quite informative",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

This can cause the oceans to stop mixing, because the temp gradient keeps the air/currents moving, and thus cause the deeper waters to lose oxygen. This sets off a climate cycle of catastrophe that has sulfur/methane microbes in the low-oxygen waters grow and create anoxic oceans. The microbes release poison hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere as well. Life in both the oceans and on land is eventually suffocated and poisoned. 

This complex cycle has been responsible for most of the mass extinction events in Earth's history. 

But don't worry, our oceans aren't losing oxygen at an alarming rate. Beaches around the world don't smell like rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide). People around the world aren't suddenly getting sick (what are the symptoms of hydrogen sulfide poisoning anyway?) We aren't in an extinction event...

When you decrease the temperature gradient (i.e. when temperatures are more uniform), you get less air movement. Low (and high) pressure systems are the result of pressure gradient, temperature gradient, and the coriolis effect interacting with air masses in such a way that gets em spinning. You also have to consider different layers of the atmosphere moving in different ways (higher up in the atmosphere, air moves more freely and much faster, towards the earths surface it’s slower and gets messed with a lot by friction). You also ALSO have to consider the interaction between ocean water (in this case, warming up) and the air above it (the ocean and our atmosphere are very connected). 

Storms getting more “extreme” could be the result of runaway feedback loops. This is more easily understood in terms of warmer storms (like hurricanes, which are basically wet and powerful ocean low-pressure systems); since the water is warmer and the air is warmer (and can thus hold more water) and the vertical temperature gradient is weaker (reducing shear), you kind of create a recipe for a nastier storm. Bear in mind though that hurricanes are finicky; if the water is TOO warm and the temp/pressure gradients are TOO weak, they won’t form. 

Another thing that melting ice caps and warming climate do is SHIFT atmospheric “streams” (if you will) in such a way that brings different kinds of weather to different areas that may not have occurred before.

It’s almost kind of like a butterfly affect ha. When you change the global temp even just a little, there’s a whole cascade of changes that can and will occur in the atmosphere and in the ocean.

Hopefully that kind of gives you some context even if it doesn’t answer your question super well.

______________

**Abstract**

We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S . This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult‐to‐quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66% range is 2.6‐3.9 K for our Baseline calculation, and remains within 2.3‐4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5‐95% ranges are 2.3‐4.7 K, bounded by 2.0‐5.7 K (although such high‐confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent, and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S , in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing‐feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.

**Plain Language Summary**

Earth's global “climate sensitivity” is a fundamental quantitative measure of the susceptibility of Earth's climate to human influence. A landmark report in 1979 concluded that it probably lies between 1.5‐4.5°C per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, assuming that other influences on climate remain unchanged. In the 40 years since, it has appeared difficult to reduce this uncertainty range. In this report we thoroughly assess all lines of evidence including some new developments. We find that a large volume of consistent evidence now points to a more confident view of a climate sensitivity near the middle or upper part of this range. In particular, it now appears extremely unlikely that the climate sensitivity could be low enough to avoid substantial climate change (well in excess of 2°C warming) under a high‐emissions future scenario. We remain unable to rule out that the sensitivity could be above 4.5°C per doubling of carbon dioxide levels, although this is not likely. Continued research is needed to further reduce the uncertainty and we identify some of the more promising possibilities in this regard.

Let’s dive into it. 

Climate change is currently being driven by an imbalance in our global carbon cycle. For billions of years, carbon would cycle through our atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere. Some of these cycles would take a very short time to go from one to the other (animals eating plants that release CO2 from cellular respiration). Others take millions or billions of years (fossilized forests turn into coal). So for billions of years that cycle would ebb and flow. Currently, we are taking millions of tons of carbon from storage in our earth and putting it into the atmosphere. This imbalance of our atmospheric composition creates a greater greenhouse effect and warms the troposphere. 

Additionally, humans are emitting compounds into our atmosphere that have a much higher greenhouse warming potential (GWP) than CO2 (CO2 has a GWP of 1). These compounds vary from methane (GWP: 36) to manmade substance like SF6 (GWP: 32600). While emitting CO2 will affect our atmosphere, these high GWP compounds affect the temperature in the atmosphere at a much higher rate than CO2 (methane is *36 times* more potent than CO2). Addressing the emissions of these compounds is paramount to addressing climate change. Stopping emissions of them will not cause a positive feedback loop. 

Broadly, scientists are looking at two ways to cool the troposphere: remove or prevent carbon from entering; or what we’ll call “geo-engineering.” The first method means we actively pull CO2 from the atmosphere and sequester it in the earths crust or another method of long term storage. This method also includes reducing the amount of carbon emitter by making more efficient energy systems. The technology for extraction and sequestration is still experimental and none has been implemented on a large scale. If we were to get really good at doing this at a large scale, there would be a chance of creating a positive feedback loop but not a big one. The natural cycle of CO2 in our atmosphere varies by a lot (I’ll check this number and get a hard number for you). It would also be a very slow process to take CO2 out so it would be easy to stop/slow down when we get close to pre-industrial levels. 

The second method is much more complicated and has a larger possibility of a positive feedback loop. Geo engineering has long been thought a solution to the climate crisis and ideas have ranged from putting a hose into the stratosphere with SO2 or creating a giant space umbrella. These ideas probably *would* work but they would have to be managed and implemented on a massive scale. Emitting SO2 into our upper atmosphere (an event that usually on occurs during massive volcanic eruption) has been proven to lower the amount of solar energy entering our troposphere (see Mt. pinatubo) but we don’t know what effective levels would be. Too little and it doesn’t do anything. Too much and we plunge ourselves into another ice age. So geo engineering is the most likely cause of a positive feedback loop. Almost every single environmental manager and policy maker advocate against geo engineering except in the most dire of situations. I like to call geo engineering a “fallacy of technology.” This fallacy says that we will find a new technology to fix a problem but opens the door for even more unintended consequences. This is the reason that so many climate science folks advocate for collective action and method one I described above. 

In short, extraction and sequestration of carbon from out atmosphere is not likely to cause a positive feedback loop given the timescale of an operation of that size. A geo engineering project is much more likely but that’s why no one wants to implement one.

The important point here is the pace of the warming. Currently CO2 are rising at least (minimal estimate) 10 times faster than the fastest of the past 66M years (no data before).

Imagine your body temperature going from 37°C to 41°C in a short period of time? You'll die if it doesn't come back soon to 37°C. Maybe you can survive a few days at 41 but that will be it. Now imagine that the human body temperature slowly rise from generation to generation, evolution happening, after millions of years the descendants of humans have a body temperature of 41°C, they're not Homo sapiens anymore tho, it's a new species, which can perfectly survive with a body temperature of 41°C (it's possible, birds have this body temperature if I remember right).

That's why the argument of looking at past periods where the Earth temperature was +4°C warmer is flawed. The Earth had time to adjust, its organism to evolve. But now it's rising so fast (saying it again, 10 times faster than the fastest observed in the past 66M years), that the consequences of +4°C won't be the same at all.

**Abstract**

Under the UN Paris Agreement, countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and to actively pursue a 1.5 °C limit. Yet, according to the 2018 Economics Nobel laureate William Nordhaus, these targets are economically suboptimal or unattainable and the world community should aim for 3.5 °C in 2100 instead. Here, we show that the UN climate targets may be optimal even in the Dynamic Integrated Climate–Economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, when appropriately updated. Changes to DICE include more accurate calibration of the carbon cycle and energy balance model, and updated climate damage estimates. To determine economically ‘optimal’ climate policy paths, we use the range of expert views on the ethics of intergenerational welfare. When updates from climate science and economics are considered jointly, we find that around three-quarters (or one-third) of expert views on intergenerational welfare translate into economically optimal climate policy paths that are consistent with the 2 °C (or 1.5 °C) target.",Positive,Global stance

______________

**Abstract**

The Piacenzian stage of the Pliocene (2.6 to 3.6 Ma) is the most recent past interval of sustained global warmth with mean global temperatures markedly higher (by ~2–3 °C) than today. Quantifying CO2 levels during the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period (mPWP) provides a means, therefore, to deepen our understanding of Earth System behaviour in a warm climate state. Here we present a new high-resolution record of atmospheric CO2 using the δ11B-pH proxy from 3.35 to 3.15 million years ago (Ma) at a temporal resolution of 1 sample per 3–6 thousand years (kyrs). Our study interval covers both the coolest marine isotope stage of the mPWP, M2 (~3.3 Ma) and the transition into its warmest phase including interglacial KM5c (centered on ~3.205 Ma) which has a similar orbital configuration to present. We find that CO2 ranged from 389 (+38 −8) ppm to 331 (+13 −11) ppm, with CO2 during the KM5c interglacial being 371 (+32 −29)  ppm (at 95% confidence). Our findings corroborate the idea that changes in atmospheric CO2 levels played a distinct role in climate variability during the mPWP. They also facilitate ongoing data-model comparisons and suggest that, at present rates of human emissions, there will be more CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere by 2025 than at any time in at least the last 3.3 million years.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Heatwaves have increased in intensity, frequency and duration, with these trends projected to worsen under enhanced global warming. Understanding regional heatwave trends has critical implications for the biophysical and human systems they impact. Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered by the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.",Positive,Global stance

_______________

**Abstract**

An extensive new multi-proxy database of paleo-temperature time series (Temperature 12k) enables a more robust analysis of global mean surface temperature (GMST) and associated uncertainties than was previously available. We applied five different statistical methods to reconstruct the GMST of the past 12,000 years (Holocene). Each method used different approaches to averaging the globally distributed time series and to characterizing various sources of uncertainty, including proxy temperature, chronology and methodological choices. The results were aggregated to generate a multi-method ensemble of plausible GMST and latitudinal-zone temperature reconstructions with a realistic range of uncertainties. The warmest 200-year-long interval took place around 6500 years ago when GMST was 0.7 °C (0.3, 1.8) warmer than the 19th Century (median, 5th, 95th percentiles). Following the Holocene global thermal maximum, GMST cooled at an average rate −0.08 °C per 1000 years (−0.24, −0.05). The multi-method ensembles and the code used to generate them highlight the utility of the Temperature 12k database, and they are now available for future use by studies aimed at understanding Holocene evolution of the Earth system.",Positive,Global stance

________________

**Abstract**

For the current generation of earth system models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, a hypothetical value of global warming at equilibrium for a doubling of CO2) is 1.8°C to 5.6°C, the largest of any generation of models dating to the 1990s. Meanwhile, the range of transient climate response (TCR, the surface temperature warming around the time of CO2 doubling in a 1% per year CO2 increase simulation) for the CMIP6 models of 1.7°C (1.3°C to 3.0°C) is only slightly larger than for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Here we review and synthesize the latest developments in ECS and TCR values in CMIP, compile possible reasons for the current values as supplied by the modeling groups, and highlight future directions. Cloud feedbacks and cloud-aerosol interactions are the most likely contributors to the high values and increased range of ECS in CMIP6.",Positive,Undefined

,2020,6,Study (open access) | Is there warming in the pipeline? A multi-model analysis of the Zero Emissions Commitment from CO2,"**Abstract**

The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) is the change in global mean temperature expected to occur following the cessation of net CO2 emissions and as such is a critical parameter for calculating the remaining carbon budget. The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. A total of 18 Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO2 concentration increases exponentially until 1000 PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Many models conducted additional second-priority simulations with different cumulative emission totals and an alternative idealized emissions pathway with a gradual transition to zero emissions. The inter-model range of ZEC 50 years after emissions cease for the 1000 PgC experiment is −0.36 to 0.29 ∘C, with a model ensemble mean of −0.07 ∘C, median of −0.05 ∘C, and standard deviation of 0.19 ∘C. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both the carbon uptake by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from the reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease. This warming effect is difficult to constrain due to high uncertainty in the efficacy of ocean heat uptake. Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on multi-decadal timescales is close to zero, consistent with previous model experiments and simple theory.

**Abstract**

The configuration of the Met Office Unified Model being submitted to CMIP6 has a high climate sensitivity. Previous studies have suggested that the impact of model changes on initial tendencies in numerical weather prediction (NWP) should be used to guide their suitability for inclusion in climate models. In this study we assess, using NWP experiments, the atmospheric model changes which lead to the increased climate sensitivity in the CMIP6 configuration, namely, the replacement of the aerosol scheme with GLOMAP‐mode and the introduction of a scheme for representing the turbulent production of liquid water within mixed‐phase cloud. Overall, the changes included in this latest configuration were found to improve the initial tendencies of the model state variables over the first 6 hr of the forecast, this timescale being before significant dynamical feedbacks are likely to occur. The reduced model drift through the forecast appears to be the result of increased cloud liquid water, leading to enhanced radiative cooling from cloud top and contributing to a stronger shortwave cloud radiative effect. These changes improve the 5‐day forecast in traditional metrics used for numerical weather prediction. This study was conducted after the model was frozen and the climate sensitivity of the model determined; hence, it provides an independent test of the model changes contributing to the higher climate sensitivity. The results, along with the large body process‐orientated evaluation conducted during the model development process, provide reassurance that these changes are improving the physical processes simulated by the model.

**Plain Language Summary**

Climate sensitivity is a leading order measure of the climate system. The latest Met Office model has a higher climate sensitivity than its predecessor and many other models, so warrants additional tests. Here we follow a published method to test in weather forecast mode, model changes contributing to the higher climate sensitivity. The model changes increasing the climate sensitivity are found to improve the short‐range weather forecast and reduce the error growth over the first few hours of the forecast which is a measure of the error in the local physical processes. This increases our confidence that the model changes contributing to the higher sensitivity are improving the physical realism of the model.

"Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases emissions produced by an individual, event or a product. Greenhouse gases include gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases which trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the warming of the earth and in turn global warming.  By reducing the carbon footprint, you can do your part to protect the limited resources on earth. Listed below are some simple changes that you can incorporate in your lifestyle to reduce carbon footprint.

**1.** **Travel Mindfully**

One of the activities that emit the most greenhouse gases is travelling. The most effective way to reduce carbon footprint would be to consider how much and how often we travel.

· **Drive less:**  Try using public transports like buses, metros as frequently as possible. For shorter distance prefer walking or cycling over fuel-powered vehicles.

· **Regularly service your car** to maintain its fuel efficiency.

· **Check tyres:** Low tyre pressure would increase your fuel consumption.

· **Avoid air conditioning** in car as much as possible.

· **Carpooling** your way to the office or other places would drastically reduce the emissions.

· **Fly less**

**2.** **Watch what you eat**

Another mass producer of greenhouse emissions is the food industry.

· **Reduce meat consumption:** Experts say that having a vegan diet is the best for the environment. Avoiding meat (especially red meat) would help in reducing your carbon footprint. The reason behind this is that for the production of red meat a lot of feed, water and land is required. Cows also give off methane emission. A vegetarian or a pescetarian diet is also better for the environment as compared to a diet that contains a lot of meat.

· Buy **locally sourced, organic and plant-based unprocessed foods** from local farmers.  Doing this would reduce your carbon footprint but switching your meat with at least one vegetarian meal a week would be more effective.

· **Minimize food wastage:** Plan meals before-hand to avoid wastage and use the leftovers rather than throwing them away. Check stock availability at home before going for grocery shopping. You can also reduce your food wastage by taking home your leftovers from a restaurant.

**3.** **Changes at home**

Some simple changes at your home will also help in reducing your carbon footprint.

· **Buy energy-efficient space heating/cooling and water heating appliances**. When buying the appliances, always check for the energy star rating.

· Turn off the lights and other appliances when not in use. To save even more energy, turn off the appliances from the power outlet.

· **Switch to LED** lights as they use less energy, last longer and are cheaper as compared to incandescent lights.

· Opt for appliances that use renewable resources, like a solar water heater.

· Get indoor plants in your living space

· Have separate bins for dry and wet waste.

· Buy products with recyclable or minimal packaging.

· Before putting a container in a recycling bin, make sure to empty and rinse the container.

· Recycle paper.

· Recycle tins made out of paper, steel and tin.

· **Compost** your food waste.

· **Reduce water usage** by using low flow faucets and showers. Using water-efficient appliances like washing machines and dishwashers would also be helpful.

_______________

**Abstract**

Using a novel agent-based model, we study how US withdrawal might influence the political process established by the Paris Agreement, and hence the prospects for reaching the collective goal to limit warming below 2°C. Our model enables us to analyze to what extent reaching this goal despite US withdrawal would place more stringent requirements on other core elements of the Paris cooperation process. We find, first, that the effect of a US withdrawal depends critically on the extent to which member countries reciprocate others’ promises and contributions. Second, while the 2°C goal will likely be reached only under a very small set of conditions in any event, even temporary US withdrawal will further narrow this set significantly. Reaching this goal will then require other countries to step up their ambition at the first opportunity and to comply nearly 100% with their pledges, while maintaining high confidence in the Paris Agreement's institutions. Third, although a US withdrawal will first primarily affect the United States' own emissions, it will eventually prove even more detrimental to other countries' emissions.

**Highlights**

• We use an agent-based model to simulate future interaction under the Paris Agreement.

• US withdrawal causes negative knock-on effects on other countries’ emissions.

• This detrimental effect is biggest under otherwise benign model settings.

______________

**Abstract**

Various transboundary river basins are facing increased pressure on water resources in near future. However, little is known about the future drivers globally, namely changes in natural local runoff and natural inflows from upstream parts of a basin, as well as local and upstream water consumption. Here we use an ensemble of four global hydrological models forced by five global climate models and the latest greenhouse‐gas concentration (RCP) and socio‐economic pathway (SSP) scenarios to assess the impact of these drivers on transboundary water stress in the past and future. Our results show that population under water stress is expected to increase by 50% under a low population growth and emissions scenario (SSP1‐RCP2.6) and double under a high population growth and emission scenario (SSP3‐RCP6.0), compared to the year 2010. As changes in water availability have a smaller effect when water is not yet scarce, changes in water stress globally are dominated by local water consumption – managing local demand is thus necessary in order to avoid future stress. Focusing then on the role of upstream changes, we identified upstream availability (i.e. less natural runoff or increased water consumption) as the dominant driver of changes in net water availability in most downstream areas. Moreover, an increased number of people will be living in areas dependent on upstream originating water in 2050. International water treaties and management will therefore have an increasingly crucial role in these hot spot regions to ensure fair management of transboundary water resources.

**Key Points**

- Water stress will mostly intensify in areas already under stress in all future scenarios for most transboundary river basins

- Changes in water stress are dominated by local water consumption – managing local demand is thus a key strategy to alleviate future stress

- Less natural runoff or increased water consumption in upstream areas is the dominant driver of changes in downstream net water availability",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

Current atmospheric CO2 concentration is known to be higher than it has been during the past ~800 k.y. of Earth history, based on direct measurement of CO2 within ice cores. A comparison to the more ancient past is complicated by a deficit of CO2 proxies that may be applied across very long spans of geologic time. Here, we present a new CO2 record across the past 23 m.y. of Earth history based on the δ13C value of terrestrial C3 plant remains, using a method applicable to the entire ~400 m.y. history of C3 photosynthesis on land. Across the past 23 m.y., CO2 likely ranged between ~230 ppmv and 350 ppmv (68% confidence interval: ~170–540 ppm). CO2 was found to be highest during the early and middle Miocene and likely below present-day levels during the middle Pliocene (84th percentile: ~400 ppmv). These data suggest present-day CO2 (412 ppmv) exceeds the highest levels that Earth experienced at least since the Miocene, further highlighting the present-day disruption of long-established CO2 trends within Earth’s atmosphere.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

The discovery in east Greenland of malformed land plant spores demonstrates that the extinction was coincident with elevated UV-B radiation demonstrating ozone layer reduction. Mercury data through the extinction level prove that, unlike other mass extinctions, there were no planetary scale volcanic eruptions. Importantly, the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary terrestrial mass extinction was coincident with a major climatic warming that ended the intense final glacial cycle of the latest Devonian ice age. A mechanism for ozone layer reduction during rapid warming is increased convective transport of ClO. Hence, ozone loss during rapid warming is an inherent Earth system process with the unavoidable conclusion that we should be alert for such an eventuality in the future warming world.",Positive,Global stance

______________

**Abstract**

Slower warming in the deep ocean encourages a perception that its biodiversity is less exposed to climate change than that of surface waters. We challenge this notion by analysing climate velocity, which provides expectations for species’ range shifts. We find that contemporary (1955–2005) climate velocities are faster in the deep ocean than at the surface. Moreover, projected climate velocities in the future (2050–2100) are faster for all depth layers, except at the surface, under the most aggressive GHG mitigation pathway considered (representative concentration pathway, RCP 2.6). This suggests that while mitigation could limit climate change threats for surface biodiversity, deep-ocean biodiversity faces an unavoidable escalation in climate velocities, most prominently in the mesopelagic (200–1,000 m). To optimize opportunities for climate adaptation among deep-ocean communities, future open-ocean protected areas must be designed to retain species moving at different speeds at different depths under climate change while managing non-climate threats, such as fishing and mining.",Positive,Global stance

_____________

**Abstract**

Stomatal closure is one of the main physiological responses to increasing CO2 concentration, which leads to a reduction in plant water loss. This response has the potential to trigger changes in the climate system by regulating surface energy budgets—a phenomenon known as CO2 physiological forcing. However, its remote impacts on the Arctic climate system are unclear. Here we show that vegetation at high latitudes enhances the Arctic amplification via remote and time-delayed physiological forcing processes. Surface warming occurs at mid-to-high latitudes due to the physiological acclimation-induced reduction in evaporative cooling and resultant increase in sensible heat flux. This excessive surface heat energy is transported to the Arctic ocean and contributes to the sea ice loss, thereby enhancing Arctic warming. The surface warming in the Arctic is further amplified by local feedbacks, and consequently the contribution of physiological effects to Arctic warming represents about 10% of radiative forcing effects.",Negative,Global stance

My concerns are hypothetical, and if this organisation does correct vetting and offsetting, they may be mitigated correctly.

My concerns regarding ecosystem impacts are:

\- Direct crushing of species by the addition of these rocks. e.g. olivine pebbles crushing buried worms and clams. Their website says that they would put rocks with a diameter of 100mm, that's fairly large and could cause a lot of crushing action hurting epibenthic organisms. I assume they will target high wave action beaches, if not then it could crush delicate organisms such as corals as well.

\- Olivine chemistry and colour may attract certain unwanted creatures, or push away key species. A simple example is coral spawn seem to be more attracted to settle onto surfaces with the colour red (e.g. on coralline algae). Perhaps there are other organisms that would be attracted or repulsed by olivine's green colour or chemical 'smell'.

\- Weathering of olivine could release unwanted chemicals. e.g. olivine may have iron and other embedded minerals. These are well known pollutants and can cause algal blooms. Of course this can be mitigated by selecting olivine sources low on these minerals. However, how likely are developing nations to care about selecting the correct olivine, particularly if they're under pressure of lowering their carbon footprint?

**Abstract**

Government policies during the COVID-19 pandemic have drastically altered patterns of energy demand around the world. Many international borders were closed and populations were confined to their homes, which reduced transport and changed consumption patterns. Here we compile government policies and activity data to estimate the decrease in CO2 emissions during forced confinements. Daily global CO2 emissions decreased by –17% (–11 to –25% for ±1σ) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, just under half from changes in surface transport. At their peak, emissions in individual countries decreased by –26% on average. The impact on 2020 annual emissions depends on the duration of the confinement, with a low estimate of –4% (–2 to –7%) if prepandemic conditions return by mid-June, and a high estimate of –7% (–3 to –13%) if some restrictions remain worldwide until the end of 2020.

**Significance**

Tropical cyclones (TCs), and particularly major TCs, pose substantial risk to many regions around the globe. Identifying changes in this risk and determining causal factors for the changes is a critical element for taking steps toward adaptation. Theory and numerical models consistently link increasing TC intensity to a warming world, but confidence in this link is compromised by difficulties in detecting significant intensity trends in observations. These difficulties are largely caused by known heterogeneities in the past instrumental records of TCs. Here we address and reduce these heterogeneities and identify significant global trends in TC intensity over the past four decades. The results should serve to increase confidence in projections of increased TC intensity under continued warming.

**Abstract**

Theoretical understanding of the thermodynamic controls on tropical cyclone (TC) wind intensity, as well as numerical simulations, implies a positive trend in TC intensity in a warming world. The global instrumental record of TC intensity, however, is known to be heterogeneous in both space and time and is generally unsuitable for global trend analysis. To address this, a homogenized data record based on satellite data was previously created for the period 1982–2009. The 28-y homogenized record exhibited increasing global TC intensity trends, but they were not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Based on observed trends in the thermodynamic mean state of the tropical environment during this period, however, it was argued that the 28-y period was likely close to, but shorter than, the time required for a statistically significant positive global TC intensity trend to appear. Here the homogenized global TC intensity record is extended to the 39-y period 1979–2017, and statistically significant (at the 95% confidence level) increases are identified. Increases and trends are found in the exceedance probability and proportion of major (Saffir−Simpson categories 3 to 5) TC intensities, which is consistent with expectations based on theoretical understanding and trends identified in numerical simulations in warming scenarios. Major TCs pose, by far, the greatest threat to lives and property. Between the early and latter halves of the time period, the major TC exceedance probability increases by about 8% per decade, with a 95% CI of 2 to 15% per decade.",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

Using Pacific benthic foraminiferal δ18O and Mg/Ca records, we derive a Cenozoic (66 Ma) global mean sea level (GMSL) estimate that records evolution from an ice-free Early Eocene to Quaternary bipolar ice sheets. These GMSL estimates are statistically similar to “backstripped” estimates from continental margins accounting for compaction, loading, and thermal subsidence. Peak warmth, elevated GMSL, high CO2, and ice-free “Hothouse” conditions (56 to 48 Ma) were followed by “Cool Greenhouse” (48 to 34 Ma) ice sheets (10 to 30 m changes). Continental-scale ice sheets (“Icehouse”) began ~34 Ma (&gt;50 m changes), permanent East Antarctic ice sheets at 12.8 Ma, and bipolar glaciation at 2.5 Ma. The largest GMSL fall (27 to 20 ka; ~130 m) was followed by a &gt;40 mm/yr rise (19 to 10 ka), a slowing (10 to 2 ka), and a stillstand until ~1900 CE, when rates began to rise.

_________________

**Abstract**

Sea-level rise projections and knowledge of their uncertainties are vital to make informed mitigation and adaptation decisions. To elicit projections from members of the scientific community regarding future global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise, we repeated a survey originally conducted five years ago. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, 106 experts projected a likely (central 66% probability) GMSL rise of 0.30–0.65 m by 2100, and 0.54–2.15 m by 2300, relative to 1986–2005. Under RCP 8.5, the same experts projected a likely GMSL rise of 0.63–1.32 m by 2100, and 1.67–5.61 m by 2300. Expert projections for 2100 are similar to those from the original survey, although the projection for 2300 has extended tails and is higher than the original survey. Experts give a likelihood of 42% (original survey) and 45% (current survey) that under the high-emissions scenario GMSL rise will exceed the upper bound (0.98 m) of the likely range estimated by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is considered to have an exceedance likelihood of 17%. Responses to open-ended questions suggest that the increases in upper-end estimates and uncertainties arose from recent influential studies about the impact of marine ice cliff instability on the meltwater contribution to GMSL rise from the Antarctic Ice Sheet.",Positive,Undefined

Humans’ ability to efficiently shed heat has enabled us to range over every continent, but a wet-bulb temperature (TW) of 35°C marks our upper physiological limit, and much lower values have serious health and productivity impacts. Climate models project the first 35°C TW occurrences by the mid-21st century. However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35°C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35°C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products. Our findings thus underscore the serious challenge posed by humid heat that is more intense than previously reported and increasingly severe.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Presently, the Indian Ocean (IO) resides in a climate state that prevents strong year-to-year climate variations. This may change under greenhouse warming, but the mechanisms remain uncertain, thus limiting our ability to predict future changes in climate extremes. Using climate model simulations, we uncover the emergence of a mode of climate variability capable of generating unprecedented sea surface temperature and rainfall fluctuations across the IO. This mode, which is inhibited under present-day conditions, becomes active in climate states with a shallow thermocline and vigorous upwelling, consistent with the predictions of continued greenhouse warming. These predictions are supported by modeling and proxy evidence of an active mode during glacial intervals that favored such a state. Because of its impact on hydrological variability, the emergence of such a mode would become a first-order source of climate-related risks for the densely populated IO rim.",Positive,Global stance

In the Amazon rainfall washes away soil nutrients in areas that aren't protected by the forest's canopy and root system, which is why the farmers there are continually making way for new farmland: Land cleared only a few years before is no longer arable.

______

**Abstract**

The storage of organic carbon in the terrestrial biosphere directly affects atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide over a wide range of timescales. Within the terrestrial biosphere, the magnitude of carbon storage can vary in response to environmental perturbations such as changing temperature or hydroclimate, potentially generating feedback on the atmospheric inventory of carbon dioxide. Although temperature controls the storage of soil organic carbon at mid and high latitudes, hydroclimate may be the dominant driver of soil carbon persistence in the tropics; however, the sensitivity of tropical soil carbon turnover to large-scale hydroclimate variability remains poorly understood. Here we show that changes in Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall have controlled the residence time of soil carbon in the Ganges–Brahmaputra basin over the past 18,000 years. Comparison of radiocarbon ages of bulk organic carbon and terrestrial higher-plant biomarkers with co-located palaeohydrological records reveals a negative relationship between monsoon rainfall and soil organic carbon stocks on a millennial timescale. Across the deglaciation period, a depletion of basin-wide soil carbon stocks was triggered by increasing rainfall and associated enhanced soil respiration rates. Our results suggest that future hydroclimate changes in tropical regions are likely to accelerate soil carbon destabilization, further increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

**Significance**

We show that for thousands of years, humans have concentrated in a surprisingly narrow subset of Earth’s available climates, characterized by mean annual temperatures around ∼13 °C. This distribution likely reflects a human temperature niche related to fundamental constraints. We demonstrate that depending on scenarios of population growth and warming, over the coming 50 y, 1 to 3 billion people are projected to be left outside the climate conditions that have served humanity well over the past 6,000 y. Absent climate mitigation or migration, a substantial part of humanity will be exposed to mean annual temperatures warmer than nearly anywhere today.

**Abstract**

All species have an environmental niche, and despite technological advances, humans are unlikely to be an exception. Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around ∼11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT &gt;29 °C currently found in only 0.8% of the Earth’s land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Summary**

Of the 45 energy technologies deemed critical by the International Energy Agency for meeting global climate targets, 38 need to improve substantially in cost and performance while accelerating deployment over the next decades (1). Low-carbon technological solutions vary in scale from solar panels, e-bikes, and smart thermostats to carbon capture and storage, light rail transit, and whole-building retrofits. We make three contributions to long-standing debates on the appropriate scale of technological responses in the energy system (2, 3). First, we focus on the specific needs of accelerated low-carbon transformation: rapid technology deployment, escaping lock-in, and social legitimacy. Second, we synthesize evidence on energy end-use technologies in homes, transport, and industry, as well as electricity generation and energy supply. Third, we go beyond technical and economic considerations to include innovation, investment, deployment, social, and equity criteria for assessing the relative advantage of alternative technologies as a function of their scale. We suggest numerous potential advantages of more-granular energy technologies for accelerating progress toward climate targets, as well as the conditions on which such progress depends.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

A rational person can agree with some policies of their opposition while disagreeing with others, and have a rational conversation about them. Most people who identify with one faction feel like they have to disagree with any position the opposition takes regardless of merit. That goes for all sides.

They imply two different possible reasons for this, local evolution or adaptation to conditions while the trees were young.

Presumably, this means that if there is a relatively small change in the climate towards more drought, most of the older trees die off, and if it hasn't exceeded the range of the species, the same species can eventually grow back without issues.

**Abstract**

Rapid sea-level rise caused by the collapse of large ice sheets is a threat to human societies. In the last deglacial period, the rate of global sea-level rise peaked at more than 4 cm yr−1 during Meltwater Pulse 1A, which coincided with the Bølling warming event some 14,650 years ago. However, the sources of the meltwater have proven elusive, and the contribution from Eurasian ice sheets has been considered negligible. Here, we present a regional carbon-14 calibration curve for the Norwegian Sea and recalibrate marine 14C dates linked to the Eurasian Ice Sheet retreat. We find that marine-based sectors of the Eurasian Ice Sheet collapsed at the Bølling transition and lost an ice volume of 4.5–7.9 m sea-level equivalents (SLE) over 500 years. During peak melting, 3.3–6.7 m SLE of ice was lost, potentially explaining up to half of Meltwater Pulse 1A. A mean meltwater flux of 0.2 Sv over 300 years was injected into the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic Ocean at a time when proxy evidence suggests vigorous Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Our reconstruction shows that massive marine-based ice sheets can collapse in as little as 300–500 years.",Negative,Undefined

**Abstract**

Using new satellite observations and atmospheric inverse modeling, we report methane emissions from the Permian Basin, which is among the world’s most prolific oil-producing regions and accounts for &gt;30% of total U.S. oil production. Based on satellite measurements from May 2018 to March 2019, Permian methane emissions from oil and natural gas production are estimated to be 2.7 ± 0.5 Tg a−1, representing the largest methane flux ever reported from a U.S. oil/gas-producing region and are more than two times higher than bottom-up inventory-based estimates. This magnitude of emissions is 3.7% of the gross gas extracted in the Permian, i.e., ~60% higher than the national average leakage rate. The high methane leakage rate is likely contributed by extensive venting and flaring, resulting from insufficient infrastructure to process and transport natural gas. This work demonstrates a high-resolution satellite data–based atmospheric inversion framework, providing a robust top-down analytical tool for quantifying and evaluating subregional methane emissions.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

We examine CMIP6 simulations of Arctic sea‐ice area and volume. We find that CMIP6 models produce a wide spread of mean Arctic sea‐ice area, capturing the observational estimate within the multi‐model ensemble spread. The CMIP6 multi‐model ensemble mean provides a more realistic estimate of the sensitivity of September Arctic sea‐ice area to a given amount of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and to a given amount of global warming, compared with earlier CMIP experiments. Still, most CMIP6 models fail to simulate at the same time a plausible evolution of sea‐ice area and of global mean surface temperature. In the vast majority of the available CMIP6 simulations, the Arctic Ocean becomes practically sea‐ice free (sea‐ice area &lt; 1 million km2) in September for the first time before the year 2050 in each of the four emission scenarios SSP1‐1.9, SSP1‐2.6, SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 examined here.

**Plain Language Summary**

We examine simulations of Arctic sea ice from the latest generation of global climate models. We find that the observed evolution of Arctic sea‐ice area lies within the spread of model simulations. In particular, the latest generation of models performs better than models from previous generations at simulating the sea‐ice loss for a given amount of CO2 emissions and for a given amount of global warming. In most simulations, the Arctic Ocean becomes practically sea‐ice free (sea‐ice area &lt; 1 million km^(2)) in September for the first time before the year 2050.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Summer 2019 observations show a rapid resurgence of the Blob-like warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that produced devastating marine impacts in the Northeast Pacific during winter 2013/2014. Unlike the original Blob, Blob 2.0 peaked in the summer, a season when little is known about the physical drivers of such events. We show that Blob 2.0 primarily results from a prolonged weakening of the North Pacific High-Pressure System. This reduces surface winds and decreases evaporative cooling and wind-driven upper ocean mixing. Warmer ocean conditions then reduce low-cloud fraction, reinforcing the marine heatwave through a positive low-cloud feedback. Using an atmospheric model forced with observed SSTs, we also find that remote SST forcing from the central equatorial and, surprisingly, the subtropical North Pacific Ocean contribute to the weakened North Pacific High. Our multi-faceted analysis sheds light on the physical drivers governing the intensity and longevity of summertime North Pacific marine heatwaves.",Positive,Undefined

**A trend of warming and drying**

Global warming has pushed what would have been a moderate drought in southwestern North America into megadrought territory. Williams et al. used a combination of hydrological modeling and tree-ring reconstructions of summer soil moisture to show that the period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest 19-year span since the late 1500s and the second driest since 800 CE (see the Perspective by Stahle). This appears to be just the beginning of a more extreme trend toward megadrought as global warming continues.

**Abstract**

Severe and persistent 21st-century drought in southwestern North America (SWNA) motivates comparisons to medieval megadroughts and questions about the role of anthropogenic climate change. We use hydrological modeling and new 1200-year tree-ring reconstructions of summer soil moisture to demonstrate that the 2000–2018 SWNA drought was the second driest 19-year period since 800 CE, exceeded only by a late-1500s megadrought. The megadrought-like trajectory of 2000–2018 soil moisture was driven by natural variability superimposed on drying due to anthropogenic warming. Anthropogenic trends in temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation estimated from 31 climate models account for 47% (model interquartiles of 35 to 105%) of the 2000–2018 drought severity, pushing an otherwise moderate drought onto a trajectory comparable to the worst SWNA megadroughts since 800 CE.",Negative,Weather extremes

**Abstract**

Exposure to high ambient temperatures is an important cause of avoidable, premature death that may become more prevalent under climate change. Though extensive epidemiological data are available in the United States, they are largely limited to select large cities, and hence, most projections estimate the potential impact of future warming on a subset of the U.S. population. Here we utilize evaluations of the relative risk of premature death associated with temperature in 10 U.S. cities spanning a wide range of climate conditions to develop a generalized risk function. We first evaluate the performance of this generalized function, which introduces substantial biases at the individual city level but performs well at the large scale. We then apply this function to estimate the impacts of projected climate change on heat‐related nationwide U.S. deaths under a range of scenarios. During the current decade, there are 12,000 (95% confidence interval 7,400–16,500) premature deaths annually in the contiguous United States, much larger than most estimates based on totals for select individual cities. These values increase by 97,000 (60,000–134,000) under the high‐warming Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and by 36,000 (22,000–50,000) under the moderate RCP4.5 scenario by 2100, whereas they remain statistically unchanged under the aggressive mitigation scenario RCP2.6. These results include estimates of adaptation that reduce impacts by ~40–45% as well as population increases that roughly offset adaptation. The results suggest that the degree of climate change mitigation will have important health impacts on Americans.",Positive,Undefined

&gt;""Further constraints on the duration of the CAMP event in Morocco are given by magnetostratigraphic studies (Knight et al., 2004; Marzoli et al., 2004) of the Tiourjdal and Oued Lahr volcanic piles, showing that basaltic eruptions occurred in a series of five pulses, each of which lasted less than a secular variation cycle (about 450 years by analogy with the duration of these cycles in the Holocene; Schnepp et al., 2003). The number of pulses calculated by Knight et al. (2004) was also based on the presence of a brief reversal event apparently recorded within a sedimentary interlayer. These authors estimated the duration of the Lower to Upper volcanism to be about 0·1 Ma, including the magnetic reversal event. Font et al. (2011) showed that this magnetic reversal event is probably not primary, but was induced by a much later overprint. Thus, if we exclude the magnetic reversal, the duration of volcanic activity at Tiourjdal may have been shorter than estimated by Knight et al. (2004) and the number of eruption pulses reduces from five to four. Therefore, the pulses were two for the Lower unit flows, one for the base of the Intermediate unit and one including the top of the Intermediate unit and all Upper flows.

**Abstract**

Large Igneous Province eruptions coincide with many major Phanerozoic mass extinctions, suggesting a cause-effect relationship where volcanic degassing triggers global climatic changes. In order to fully understand this relationship, it is necessary to constrain the quantity and type of degassed magmatic volatiles, and to determine the depth of their source and the timing of eruption. Here we present direct evidence of abundant CO2 in basaltic rocks from the end-Triassic Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), through investigation of gas exsolution bubbles preserved by melt inclusions. Our results indicate abundance of CO2 and a mantle and/or lower-middle crustal origin for at least part of the degassed carbon. The presence of deep carbon is a key control on the emplacement mode of CAMP magmas, favouring rapid eruption pulses (a few centuries each). Our estimates suggest that the amount of CO2 that each CAMP magmatic pulse injected into the end-Triassic atmosphere is comparable to the amount of anthropogenic emissions projected for the 21st century. Such large volumes of volcanic CO2 likely contributed to end-Triassic global warming and ocean acidification.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Slipping on till**

How do glaciers flow over the ground underlying them? We know that friction, ice stream velocity, and water pressure at the ice bed all matter, but we still do not know how to represent the process over both hard beds (which are solid rock) and soft ones (composed of unconsolidated erosion products called till). Zoet and Iverson present experimental results describing how glacial ice moves over watersaturated till (see the Perspective by Minchew and Joughin). These observations should help to solve the long-standing problem of constructing a generalized slip law that combines the processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.

**Abstract**

Slip of marine-terminating ice streams over beds of deformable till is responsible for most of the contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea level rise. Flow models of the ice sheet and till-bedded glaciers elsewhere require a law that relates slip resistance, slip velocity, and water pressure at the bed. We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed. Steady-state slip resistance increases with slip velocity owing to sliding of ice across the bed, but above a threshold velocity, till shears at its rate-independent Coulomb strength. These results motivate a generalized slip law for glacier-flow models that combines processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

The mid-Cretaceous period was one of the warmest intervals of the past 140 million years driven by atmospheric carbon dioxide levels of around 1,000 parts per million by volume6. In the near absence of proximal geological records from south of the Antarctic Circle, it is disputed whether polar ice could exist under such environmental conditions. Here we use a sedimentary sequence recovered from the West Antarctic shelf—the southernmost Cretaceous record reported so far—and show that a temperate lowland rainforest environment existed at a palaeolatitude of about 82° S during the Turonian–Santonian age (92 to 83 million years ago). This record contains an intact 3-metre-long network of in situ fossil roots embedded in a mudstone matrix containing diverse pollen and spores. A climate model simulation shows that the reconstructed temperate climate at this high latitude requires a combination of both atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of 1,120–1,680 parts per million by volume and a vegetated land surface without major Antarctic glaciation, highlighting the important cooling effect exerted by ice albedo under high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Galaasen et al. report that episodes of reduced NADW over the past 500,000 years actually have been relatively common and occasionally long-lasting features of interglacials and that they can occur independently of the catastrophic freshwater outburst floods normally thought to be their cause (see the Perspective by Stocker). This discovery implies that large NADW disruptions might be more likely than we have assumed in the warmer climate of the future.


**Abstract**

Disrupting North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) ventilation is a key concern in climate projections. We use (sub)centennially resolved bottom water δ13C records that span the interglacials of the last 0.5 million years to assess the frequency of and the climatic backgrounds capable of triggering large NADW reductions. Episodes of reduced NADW in the deep Atlantic, similar in magnitude to glacial events, have been relatively common and occasionally long-lasting features of interglacials. NADW reductions were triggered across the range of recent interglacial climate backgrounds, which demonstrates that catastrophic freshwater outburst floods were not a prerequisite for large perturbations. Our results argue that large NADW disruptions are more easily achieved than previously appreciated and that they occurred in past climate conditions similar to those we may soon face.",Positive,Global stance

**Highlights**

- This study presents estimates of global coal mine methane emissions through 2100.

- Methane emissions related to coal extraction are higher than reported from previous estimates.

- Coal mines continue emitting methane even if coal production is ceased.

- Evidence-based emission factors are applied to account for increasing mining depth.

- A new methodology for calculating emissions from abandoned mines is proposed.


**Abstract**

This paper presents projections of global methane emissions from coal mining under different coal extraction scenarios and with increasing mining depth through 2100. The paper proposes an updated methodology for calculating fugitive emissions from coal mining, which accounts for coal extraction method, coal rank, and mining depth and uses evidence-based emissions factors. A detailed assessment shows that coal mining-related methane emissions in 2010 were higher than previous studies show. This study also uses a novel methodology for calculating methane emissions from abandoned coal mines and represents the first estimate of future global methane emissions from those mines. The results show that emissions from the growing population of abandoned mines increase faster than those from active ones. Using coal production data from six integrated assessment models, this study shows that by 2100 methane emissions from active underground mines increase by a factor of 4, while emissions from abandoned mines increase by a factor of 8. Abandoned mine methane emissions continue through the century even with aggressive mitigation actions.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Highlights**

- Global-scale analysis of marine species shows abundance changes linked to warming
   
- Increases at poleward sides of species ranges reflect new ecological opportunities

- Declines at equatorward sides show failure to adapt to rapid climate change

- Results imply future warming will impact further on abundance of marine species

**Summary**

Marine environments have increased in temperature by an average of 1°C since pre-industrial (1850) times. Given that species ranges are closely allied to physiological thermal tolerances in marine organisms, it may therefore be expected that ocean warming would lead to abundance increases at poleward side of ranges and abundance declines toward the equator. Here, we report a global analysis of abundance trends of 304 widely distributed marine species over the last century, across a range of taxonomic groups from phytoplankton to fish and marine mammals. Specifically, using a literature database, we investigate the extent that the direction and strength of long-term species abundance changes depend on the sampled location within the latitudinal range of species. Our results show that abundance increases have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the poleward side of species ranges, and abundance declines have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the equatorward side of species ranges. These data provide evidence of omnipresent large-scale changes in abundance of marine species consistent with warming over the last century and suggest that adaptation has not provided a buffer against the negative effects of warmer conditions at the equatorward extent of species ranges. On the basis of these results, we suggest that projected sea temperature increases of up to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels by 2050 will continue to drive latitudinal abundance shifts in marine species, including those of importance for coastal livelihoods.",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

The electrification of passenger road transport and household heating features prominently in current and planned policy frameworks to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. However, since electricity generation involves using fossil fuels, it is not established where and when the replacement of fossil-fuel-based technologies by electric cars and heat pumps can effectively reduce overall emissions. Could electrification policies backfire by promoting their diffusion before electricity is decarbonized? Here we analyse current and future emissions trade-offs in 59 world regions with heterogeneous households, by combining forward-looking integrated assessment model simulations with bottom-up life-cycle assessments. We show that already under current carbon intensities of electricity generation, electric cars and heat pumps are less emission intensive than fossil-fuel-based alternatives in 53 world regions, representing 95% of the global transport and heating demand. Even if future end-use electrification is not matched by rapid power-sector decarbonization, it will probably reduce emissions in almost all world regions.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Plain Language Summary**

The response to volcanic eruptions is a critical benchmark of the performance of climate models. Previous studies of the past millennium have identified discrepancies between model simulations and climate reconstructions regarding the temperature response to volcanic eruptions, raising concerns regarding the source of this mismatch and implications for both models and reconstructions. By evaluating the leading sources of differences between simulations and reconstructions, this study shows that accounting for known factors largely bridges the gap.

**Abstract**

Explosive volcanism imposes impulse-like radiative forcing on the climate system, providing a natural experiment to study the climate response to perturbation. Previous studies have identified disagreements between paleoclimate reconstructions and climate model simulations (GCMs) with respect to the magnitude and recovery from volcanic cooling, questioning the fidelity of GCMs, reconstructions, or both. Using the paleoenvironmental data assimilation framework of the Last Millennium Reanalysis, this study investigates the causes of the disagreements, using both real and simulated data. We demonstrate that discrepancies since 1600 CE can be largely resolved by assimilating tree-ring density records only, targeting growing-season temperature instead of annual temperature, and performing the comparison at proxy locales. Simulations of eruptions earlier in the last millennium may also reflect uncertainties in forcing and modeled aerosol microphysics.",Negative,Undefined

&gt;... the climatological community has defined four types of drought: 1) meteorological drought, 2) hydrological drought, 3) agricultural drought, and 4) socioeconomic drought. Meteorological drought happens when dry weather patterns dominate an area. Hydrological drought occurs when low water supply becomes evident, especially in streams, reservoirs, and groundwater levels, usually after many months of meteorological drought. Agricultural drought happens when crops become affected. And socioeconomic drought relates the supply and demand of various commodities to drought.

There are a handful of indices to define drought, some look at only precipitation, some include evapotranspiration , and others soil type. Some python code to calculate them yourself if you have station data and also the definitions of some of the indices can be found at [https://www.drought.gov/drought/climate-and-drought-indices-python](https://www.drought.gov/drought/climate-and-drought-indices-python).

One piece of explanation might be: No person or nation can _alone_ stop the climate crisis, which makes it so much harder to make progress. It's a _tragedy of the commons_, where the effectiveness of your own reduction depends on what everybody else does. If they don't care enough, it seems almost futile to care yourself. It is absolutely necessary to make international agreements to protect our climate, unless one singular nation has enough capacity to suck more carbon out of our atmosphere than all the others emit.

COVID-19 is much easier to handle as you don't have to make international agreements to protect your country/town/family/yourself. Everybody and every country can care for their own medical personell, medical supplies, can enact new rules if necessary like social distancing. Wether this country/town/family/person succeeds in their strategy of defending themselves against the virus depends to a good part on their own actions. Yes, of course international cooperation is very helpful with COVID-19, too, but in contrast to our climate, it _can_ be solved locally or regionally.

So one problem is impossible to solve without international cooperation, and the other can be solved on any level autonomously. It is still absolutely necessary that we solve both.

As such, I have great hopes that we can build a bridge between the two, and learn from our current measures what we could do to solve the climate problem as well. Teleworking is a good step in the right direction, so is a reduction in air travel.",Positive,Undefined

**An underground record of past deglaciations**

Understanding more exactly how the timing of deglaciations depends on changes in insolation, or the energy received by Earth from the Sun, requires precise and independent records of both environmental change and solar energy input. Bajo et al. strengthened the weak link of that two-member chain, the environmental record, by developing a precise, radiometrically dated chronology of the 11 deglaciations of the past million years derived from speleothems. This allowed them to show more clearly how the initiation and duration of glacial terminations over that period depended on solar obliquity and precession.

**Abstract**

Radiometric dating of glacial terminations over the past 640,000 years suggests pacing by Earth’s climatic precession, with each glacial-interglacial period spanning four or five cycles of ~20,000 years. However, the lack of firm age estimates for older Pleistocene terminations confounds attempts to test the persistence of precession forcing. We combine an Italian speleothem record anchored by a uranium-lead chronology with North Atlantic ocean data to show that the first two deglaciations of the so-called 100,000-year world are separated by two obliquity cycles, with each termination starting at the same high phase of obliquity, but at opposing phases of precession. An assessment of 11 radiometrically dated terminations spanning the past million years suggests that obliquity exerted a persistent influence on not only their initiation but also their duration.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Heat stress harms human health, agriculture, and the economy and environment more broadly, and exposure to heat stress is increasing with rising global temperatures. While most studies assessing future heat stress have focused on surface air temperature, compound extremes of heat and humidity are key drivers of heat stress. Here, we use atmospheric reanalysis data and a large initial-condition ensemble simulations of a global climate model to evaluate future changes in daily compound heat-humidity extremes as a function of increasing global-mean surface air temperature (GSAT). The changing frequency of heat-humidity extremes, measured using wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), is strongly related to GSAT and, conditional upon GSAT, nearly independent of forcing pathway. The historical ~1°C of GSAT increase above preindustrial levels has already increased the population annually exposed to at least one day with WBGT exceeding 33°C (the reference safety value for humans at rest per the ISO-7243 standard) from 97 million to 275 million. Maintaining the current population distribution, this exposure is projected to increase to 508 million with 1.5°C of warming, 789 million with 2.0°C of warming, and 1.22 billion with 3.0°C of warming (similar to late-century warming projected based on current mitigation policies).",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

For this hydrogen often acts the same as methane.

The only physics test I ever got 100% for and the teacher told me he had not looked at the other answers. ;-)

But that is long ago. One link is that the greenhouse effect (of methane, not hydrogen) makes the Earth's surface warmer, but the stratosphere colder. Colder temperatures favor the chemical reactions that break down ozone. See the ozone hole in the winter above the poles.

And methane is a source of water in the stratosphere, water is one substances responsible for ozone being destroyed. It is hard for water to directly enter the stratosphere, because it has to pass the really cold stratopause, which freeze dries the air.

I guess that is twice as good as the test question required, but I draw black on the other two. It is too long ago. It was already text book knowledge then, so a good science book on the chemistry and physics of the ozone layer will likely detail this.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Abstract**

The Greenland Ice Sheet has been a major contributor to global sea-level rise in recent decades and it is expected to continue to be so. Although increases in glacier flow and surface melting have been driven by oceanic and atmospheric warming, the magnitude and trajectory of the ice sheet’s mass imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet’s volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. The ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, but annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 345 ± 66 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,902 ± 342 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.8 ± 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that the reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,964 ± 565 billion tonnes (50.3 per cent) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,938 ± 541 billion tonnes (49.7 per cent) of ice loss was due to increased glacier dynamical imbalance, which rose from 46 ± 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 ± 25 billion tonnes per year since then. The total rate of ice loss slowed to 222 ± 30 billion tonnes per year between 2013 and 2017, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions and ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbræ. Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the rates predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their high-end climate warming scenario, which forecast an additional 70 to 130 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 compared with their central estimate.",Negative,Politics

**Abstract**

The Antarctic Ice Sheet is an important indicator of climate change and driver of sea-level rise. Here we combine satellite observations of its changing volume, flow and gravitational attraction with modelling of its surface mass balance to show that it lost 2,720 ± 1,390 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2017, which corresponds to an increase in mean sea level of 7.6 ± 3.9 millimetres (errors are one standard deviation). Over this period, ocean-driven melting has caused rates of ice loss from West Antarctica to increase from 53 ± 29 billion to 159 ± 26 billion tonnes per year; ice-shelf collapse has increased the rate of ice loss from the Antarctic Peninsula from 7 ± 13 billion to 33 ± 16 billion tonnes per year. We find large variations in and among model estimates of surface mass balance and glacial isostatic adjustment for East Antarctica, with its average rate of mass gain over the period 1992–2017 (5 ± 46 billion tonnes per year) being the least certain.",Negative,Politics

**Abstract**

Changes in climate are usually considered in terms of trends or differences over time. However, for many impacts requiring adaptation, it is the amplitude of the change relative to the local amplitude of climate variability which is more relevant. Here, we develop the concept of ‘signal‐to‐noise’ in observations of local temperature, highlighting that many regions are already experiencing a climate which would be ‘unknown’ by late 19th century standards. The emergence of observed temperature changes over both land and ocean is clearest in tropical regions, in contrast to the regions of largest change which are in the northern extra‐tropics – broadly consistent with climate model simulations. Significant increases and decreases in rainfall have also already emerged in different regions with the UK experiencing a shift towards more extreme rainfall events, a signal which is emerging more clearly in some places than the changes in mean rainfall.

**Plain Language Summary**

Changes in climate are translated into impacts on society not just though the amount of change, but how this change compares to the variations in climate that society is used to. Here we demonstrate that significant changes, when compared to the size of past variations, are present in both temperature and rainfall observations over many parts of the world.

**Key Points**

- The signal of changes in observed temperature and rainfall due to global warming has clearly emerged in many regions and at meso‐scales

- Tropical regions have experienced the largest changes in temperature relative to the amplitude of internal variability

- Signals of increasing extreme rainfall are emerging more quickly than signals in mean rainfall over many parts of the UK",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) was a gradual warming event and carbon cycle perturbation that occurred between 40.5 and 40.1 Ma. A number of characteristics, including greater‐than‐expected deep‐sea carbonate dissolution, a lack of globally‐coherent negative δ13C excursion in marine carbonates, a duration longer than the characteristic timescale of carbon‐cycle recovery, and the absence of a clear trigger mechanism, challenge our current understanding of the Earth system and its regulatory feedbacks. This makes the MECO one of the most enigmatic events in the Cenozoic, dubbed a middle Eocene ‘carbon cycle conundrum’. Here we use boron isotopes in planktic foraminifera to better constrain pCO2 changes over the event. Over the MECO itself, we find that pCO2 rose by only 0.55‐0.75 doublings, thus requiring a much more modest carbon injection than previously indicated by the alkenone δ13C‐pCO2 proxy. In addition, this rise in pCO2 was focused around the peak of the 400 kyr warming trend. Before this, considerable global carbonate δ18O change was asynchronous with any coherent ocean pH (and hence pCO2) excursion. This finding suggests that middle Eocene climate (and perhaps a nascent cryosphere) was highly sensitive to small changes in radiative forcing.

**Plain Language Summary**

Geoscientists often look to periods of global warming in the geological past to understand how the Earth responds to input of atmospheric CO2. However, during the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (or MECO) 40 million years ago, the Earth did not respond in the way one would expect, given what we know from these earlier warming events. The MECO poses a number of puzzles for geoscientists relating to what caused it, and why the Earth system responded in the way it did. Before we can hope to answer these questions, however, we need to know what atmospheric CO2 levels were in the middle Eocene, and how much they changed over the MECO event. Here we use boron isotope ratios in fossil plankton shells to tell us how ocean pH (which predominantly reflects CO2 levels) changed over the MECO. We show that relatively little change in CO2 at this time were associated with large‐scale changes in climate. This suggests that during the Eocene, when CO2 levels were similar to those likely to be reached by the end of this century, the Earth's climate (and possibly ice sheets) were very sensitive to minor disturbances.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

_____________

**Abstract**

Structurally intact tropical forests sequestered about half of the global terrestrial carbon uptake over the 1990s and early 2000s, removing about 15 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest ‘carbon sink’ will continue for decades. Here we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53–0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests. Therefore the carbon sink responses of Earth’s two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature. Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth’s intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, independent observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern Hemisphere landmass reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already peaked. This saturation and ongoing decline of the tropical forest carbon sink has consequences for policies intended to stabilize Earth’s climate.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

_____________

**Abstract**

Columbia River megafloods occurred repeatedly during the last deglaciation, but the impacts of this fresh water on Pacific hydrography are largely unknown. To reconstruct changes in ocean circulation during this period, we used a numerical model to simulate the flow trajectory of Columbia River megafloods and compiled records of sea surface temperature, paleo-salinity, and deep-water radiocarbon from marine sediment cores in the Northeast Pacific. The North Pacific sea surface cooled and freshened during the early deglacial (19.0-16.5 ka) and Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka) intervals, coincident with the appearance of subsurface water masses depleted in radiocarbon relative to the sea surface. We infer that Pacific meltwater fluxes contributed to net Northern Hemisphere cooling prior to North Atlantic Heinrich Events, and again during the Younger Dryas stadial. Abrupt warming in the Northeast Pacific similarly contributed to hemispheric warming during the Bølling and Holocene transitions. These findings underscore the importance of changes in North Pacific freshwater fluxes and circulation in deglacial climate events.",Negative,Weather extremes

____

**Abstract**

During the Last Glacial Maximum, expansive continental ice sheets lowered globally averaged sea level ~130 m, exposing a land bridge at the Bering Strait. During the subsequent deglaciation, sea level rose rapidly and ultimately flooded the Bering Strait, linking the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. Observational records of the Bering Strait flooding have suggested two apparently contradictory scenarios for the timing of the reconnection. We reconcile these enigmatic datasets using gravitationally self-consistent sea-level simulations that vary the timing and geometry of ice retreat between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets to the southwest of the Bering Strait to fit observations of a two-phased flooding history. Assuming the datasets are robust, we demonstrate that their reconciliation requires a substantial melting of the Cordilleran and western Laurentide Ice Sheet from 13,000 to 11,500 years ago. This timing provides a freshwater source for the widely debated Younger Dryas cold episode (12,900 to 11,700 years ago).",Negative,Global stance

**Small burden from old sources**

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with large natural sources, reservoirs, and sinks. Dyonisius et al. found that methane emissions from old, cold-region carbon reservoirs like permafrost and methane hydrates were minor during the last deglaciation (see the Perspective by Dean). They analyzed the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric methane trapped in bubbles in Antarctic ice and found that methane emissions from those old carbon sources during the warming interval were small. They argue that this finding suggests that methane emissions in response to future warming likely will not be as large as some have suggested.

Science, this issue p. 907; see also p. 846

**Abstract**

Permafrost and methane hydrates are large, climate-sensitive old carbon reservoirs that have the potential to emit large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as the Earth continues to warm. We present ice core isotopic measurements of methane (Δ14C, δ13C, and δD) from the last deglaciation, which is a partial analog for modern warming. Our results show that methane emissions from old carbon reservoirs in response to deglacial warming were small (&lt;19 teragrams of methane per year, 95% confidence interval) and argue against similar methane emissions in response to future warming. Our results also indicate that methane emissions from biomass burning in the pre-Industrial Holocene were 22 to 56 teragrams of methane per year (95% confidence interval), which is comparable to today.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Time series of meteorological parameters at ten Greek airports since 1955 indicated the level of climate change in the Eastern Mediterranean area. Using this data, take-off performance was analysed for the DHC-8-400—a typical short range turboprop airliner, and the A320, a typical medium scale turbofan airliner. For airports with longer runways, a steady but unimportant increase in take-off distances was found. For airports with shorter runways, the results indicate a steady reduction in available payload. At the most extreme case, results show that for an Airbus A320, operating from the, relatively short, 1511m runway at Chios Airport, the required reduction in payload would be equivalent to 38 passengers with their luggage, or fuel for 700 nautical miles (1300 km) per flight, for the period between the A320’s entry to service in 1988 and 2017. These results indicate that for airports where aeroplane maximum take-off mass is a performance limited function of runway length, and where minimum temperatures have increased and/or mean headwind components decreased, climate change has already had a marked impact on the economic activity in the airline industry. Similar analyses could be usefully carried out for other runway-length–limited airports, which may often include island airports. It is also noted that previous research has only considered temperature effects, and not wind effects. Wind effects in this study are less significant than temperature, but nonetheless have an effect on both field performance noise and pollution nuisance around airports.",Negative,Undefined

____

**Abstract**

Whether Arctic amplification has contributed to a wavier circulation and more frequent extreme weather in midlatitudes remains an open question. For two to three decades starting from the mid-1980s, accelerated Arctic warming and a reduced meridional near-surface temperature gradient coincided with a wavier circulation. However, waviness remains largely unchanged in model simulations featuring strong Arctic amplification. Here, we show that the previously reported trend toward a wavier circulation during autumn and winter has reversed in recent years, despite continued Arctic amplification, resulting in negligible multidecadal trends. Models capture the observed correspondence between a reduced temperature gradient and increased waviness on interannual to decadal time scales. However, model experiments in which a reduced temperature gradient is imposed do not feature increased wave amplitude. Our results strongly suggest that the observed and simulated covariability between waviness and temperature gradients on interannual to decadal time scales does not represent a forced response to Arctic amplification.

**Abstract**

Widely regarded as an imminent threat to our oceans, ocean acidification has been documented in all oceanic basins. Projected changes in seawater chemistry will have catastrophic biotic effects due to ocean acidification hindering biogenic carbonate production, which will in turn lead to substantial changes in marine ecosystems. However, previous attempts to quantify the effect of acidification on planktonic calcifying organisms has relied on laboratory based studies with substantial methodological limitations. This has been overcome by comparing historic plankton tows from the seminal HMS Challenger Expedition (1872–1876) with the recent Tara Oceans expedition material (2009–2016). Nano CT-scans of selected equatorial Pacific Ocean planktonic foraminifera, have revealed that all modern specimens had up to 76% thinner shells than their historic counterparts. The “Challenger Revisited” project highlights the potential of historic ocean collections as a tool to investigate ocean acidification since the early Industrial Revolution. Further analyses of such biotic archives will enable researchers to quantify the effects of anthropogenic climate change across the globe.",Negative,Global stance

____

**Significance**

Marine microbe growth is limited by iron over about half of the global ocean surface. Dissolved iron is quickly lost from the ocean, but its availability to marine microbes may be enhanced by binding with organic molecules which, in turn, are produced by microbes. We hypothesize this forms a reinforcing cycle between biological activity and iron cycling that locally matches the availability of iron and other nutrients, leading to global-scale resource colimitation between macronutrients and micronutrients, and maximizing biological productivity. Idealized models support this hypothesis, depending on the specific relationships between microbial sources and sinks of organic molecules. An evolutionary selection may have occurred which optimizes these characteristics, resulting in “just enough” iron in the ocean.

**Abstract**

Iron is the limiting factor for biological production over a large fraction of the surface ocean because free iron is rapidly scavenged or precipitated under aerobic conditions. Standing stocks of dissolved iron are maintained by association with organic molecules (ligands) produced by biological processes. We hypothesize a positive feedback between iron cycling, microbial activity, and ligand abundance: External iron input fuels microbial production, creating organic ligands that support more iron in seawater, leading to further macronutrient consumption until other microbial requirements such as macronutrients or light become limiting, and additional iron no longer increases productivity. This feedback emerges in numerical simulations of the coupled marine cycles of macronutrients and iron that resolve the dynamic microbial production and loss of iron-chelating ligands. The model solutions resemble modern nutrient distributions only over a finite range of prescribed ligand source/sink ratios where the model ocean is driven to global-scale colimitation by micronutrients and macronutrients and global production is maximized. We hypothesize that a global-scale selection for microbial ligand cycling may have occurred to maintain “just enough” iron in the ocean.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Atmospheric methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas, and its mole fraction has more than doubled since the preindustrial era. Fossil fuel extraction and use are among the largest anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions, but the precise magnitude of these contributions is a subject of debate. Carbon-14 in CH4 (^(14)CH4) can be used to distinguish between fossil (^(14)C-free) CH4 emissions and contemporaneous biogenic sources; however, poorly constrained direct ^(14)CH4 emissions from nuclear reactors have complicated this approach since the middle of the 20th century. Moreover, the partitioning of total fossil CH4 emissions (presently 172 to 195 teragrams CH4 per year) between anthropogenic and natural geological sources (such as seeps and mud volcanoes) is under debate; emission inventories suggest that the latter account for about 40 to 60 teragrams CH4 per year. Geological emissions were less than 15.4 teragrams CH4 per year at the end of the Pleistocene, about 11,600 years ago, but that period is an imperfect analogue for present-day emissions owing to the large terrestrial ice sheet cover, lower sea level and extensive permafrost. Here we use preindustrial-era ice core ^(14)CH4 measurements to show that natural geological CH4 emissions to the atmosphere were about 1.6 teragrams CH4 per year, with a maximum of 5.4 teragrams CH4 per year (95 per cent confidence limit)—an order of magnitude lower than the currently used estimates. This result indicates that anthropogenic fossil CH4 emissions are underestimated by about 38 to 58 teragrams CH4 per year, or about 25 to 40 per cent of recent estimates. Our record highlights the human impact on the atmosphere and climate, provides a firm target for inventories of the global CH4 budget, and will help to inform strategies for targeted emission reductions.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

As for water touching metal, I think that yes a small puddle of water on a metal surface would evaporate slightly faster (although if the metal reflects sunlight it might be cooler, so actually evaporate slower).

are you imagining that additional evaporative losses might increase atmospheric humidity (and the greenhouse effect) and thereby be a undervalued parameter? -if so Carbon dioxide would have a lower forcing figure.


Admittedly I doubt the amount of metal would be a fraction of what might be required to effect climate in a meaningful way, but it is good to consider as modelling of complex systems tends to necessarily ignore low sensitivity parameters that may in fact trigger the higher ones in unforeseen ways (because it’s a complex system!).

The sun and the specific heat capacity of water (good term to understand) and the volume of that water in the world is I think a principal consideration in global heat transfer (at least in the context of this thread). Both oceans and the air. The evaporation from oceans due to solar warming generally will make any comparison with evaporation from metal insignificant. Most important for climate is the lag we experience in the oceans of possibly 80 years between solar cycles and this is due to the massive specific heat capacity of water. Which incidentally might be a factor in the hoover dam example -I suppose.

In building science, (more my field than pure climate) We would usually concern ourselves with condensation on metallic surfaces (due to the high heat transfer) rather than evaporation, as the latter is a factor of air flow and humidity. Heat loss via thermal bridging through metal in buildings is a consideration in developing energy efficient designs. This is via conduction though and not evaporation.
at least in cooling scenarios you would perhaps rely on radiative losses via an emissive surface pointing towards the northern sky. 
Ultimately, to effect planetary temperatures, any heat transfer must escape into space and this must be via radiation.",Positive,Undefined

"I always assumed that it would be a climate neutral alternative to regular planes but a few things got me thinking.
Water vapor is the main driver of the greenhouse effect and while regular planes emit both water and co2, a hydrogen plane would emit probably more water into the stratosphere since water is the only chemical reaction product.

Now it gets even more confusing for me. Afaik Water vapor is a transperant gas while clouds and artificial clouds from airplanes are already condensed water into tiny droplets. The vapor is a greenhouse gas but the clouds or droplets are actually having a positive effect because they reflect visible light coming from the sun.
Edit: apparently only low altitude clouds are having a cooling effect on the planet while high altitude clouds like these from airplanes are actually further contributing to the greenhouse effect.

____

**Abstract**

Methane (CH4) emissions from thawing permafrost amplify a climate warming feedback. However, upscaling of site‐level CH4 observations across diverse Arctic landscapes remains highly uncertain, compromising accuracy of current pan‐Arctic CH4 budgets and confidence in model forecasts. We report a 30,000‐km2 survey at 25‐m2 resolution (~1 billion observations) of CH4 hotspot patterns across Alaska and northwestern Canada using airborne imaging spectroscopy. Hotspots covered 0.2% of the surveyed area, concentrated in the wetland‐upland ecotone, and followed a two‐component power law as a function of distance from standing water. Hotspots decreased sharply over the first 40 m from standing water (y = 0.21×−0.649, R2 = 0.97), mirroring in situ flux observations. Beyond 40 m, CH4 hotspots diminished gradually over hundreds of meters (y = 0.004×−0.164, R2 = 0.99). This emergent property quantifies the distribution of strong methanogenic zones from site to regional scales, vastly improving metrics for scaling ground‐based CH4 inventories and validation of land models.

**Plain Language Summary**

Understanding Arctic methane emissions is crucial to forecasting the region's impact on global climate. Ongoing efforts suffer large uncertainties when upscaling emissions since direct observations rarely cover scales relevant to both process‐level (fine‐scale) biogeochemistry and land models that operate on much larger scales. We bridge these scale gaps via high‐resolution airborne detection of methane hotspots (25‐m2 pixels) across a 30,000‐km2 study domain. We quantified a key spatial property of Arctic methane emissions: their power law dependence on distance to nearest standing water. From the ground, we verified that wide‐ranging methane fluxes follow the same spatial power law pattern as domain‐wide hotspots. These conclusions can improve scaling of emissions in Arctic land models and potentially reduce the disparity between ground‐based and atmospheric emission budgeting.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Growing conditions for crops such as coffee and wine grapes are shifting to track climate change. Research on these crop responses has focused principally on impacts to food production impacts, but evidence is emerging that they may have serious environmental consequences as well. Recent research has documented potential environmental impacts of shifting cropping patterns, including impacts on water, wildlife, pollinator interaction, carbon storage and nature conservation, on national to global scales. Multiple crops will be moving in response to shifting climatic suitability, and the cumulative environmental effects of these multi-crop shifts at global scales is not known. Here we model for the first time multiple major global commodity crop suitability changes due to climate change, to estimate the impacts of new crop suitability on water, biodiversity and carbon storage. Areas that become newly suitable for one or more crops are Climate-driven Agricultural Frontiers. These frontiers cover an area equivalent to over 30% of the current agricultural land on the planet and have major potential impacts on biodiversity in tropical mountains, on water resources downstream and on carbon storage in high latitude lands. Frontier soils contain up to 177 Gt of C, which might be subject to release, which is the equivalent of over a century of current United States CO2 emissions. Watersheds serving over 1.8 billion people would be impacted by the cultivation of the climate-driven frontiers. Frontiers intersect 19 global biodiversity hotspots and the habitat of 20% of all global restricted range birds. Sound planning and management of climate-driven agricultural frontiers can therefore help reduce globally significant impacts on people, ecosystems and the climate system.",Positive,Global stance

____

**Significance**

Fifty years ago, it was speculated that the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet is vulnerable to warming and may have melted in the past. Testing this hypothesis has proved challenging due to the difficulty of developing in situ records of ice sheet and environmental change spanning warm periods. We present a multiproxy record that implies loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Last Interglacial (129,000 to 116,000 y ago), associated with ocean warming and the release of greenhouse gas methane from marine sediments. Our ice sheet modeling predicts that Antarctica may have contributed several meters to global sea level at this time, suggesting that this ice sheet lies close to a “tipping point” under projected warming.

**Abstract**

The future response of the Antarctic ice sheet to rising temperatures remains highly uncertain. A useful period for assessing the sensitivity of Antarctica to warming is the Last Interglacial (LIG) (129 to 116 ky), which experienced warmer polar temperatures and higher global mean sea level (GMSL) (+6 to 9 m) relative to present day. LIG sea level cannot be fully explained by Greenland Ice Sheet melt (∼2 m), ocean thermal expansion, and melting mountain glaciers (∼1 m), suggesting substantial Antarctic mass loss was initiated by warming of Southern Ocean waters, resulting from a weakening Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in response to North Atlantic surface freshening. Here, we report a blue-ice record of ice sheet and environmental change from the Weddell Sea Embayment at the periphery of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which is underlain by major methane hydrate reserves. Constrained by a widespread volcanic horizon and supported by ancient microbial DNA analyses, we provide evidence for substantial mass loss across the Weddell Sea Embayment during the LIG, most likely driven by ocean warming and associated with destabilization of subglacial hydrates. Ice sheet modeling supports this interpretation and suggests that millennial-scale warming of the Southern Ocean could have triggered a multimeter rise in global sea levels. Our data indicate that Antarctica is highly vulnerable to projected increases in ocean temperatures and may drive ice–climate feedbacks that further amplify warming.",Positive,Global stance

This article assesses advertising expenditures by five major oil and gasoline companies for the time period 1986 to 2015. We examine four major factors that may influence spending on advertising by the oil and gas sectors: (1) the overall reputation of the oil and gas sector; (2) congressional attention to climate change; (3) media attention to climate change; and (4) a series of control variables including major oil spills, the publication of major climate change reports, overall public concern about climate change, GDP, and oil prices.

"Much of modern warming occurred between ~1980 and ~2000, [HADCRUT](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadCRUT4.png) puts warming at +0.5°C, and as I shall argue, the magnitude of temperature increase cannot be fully explained by either changes in solar output (1W/m2 output) nor increased CO2 (~1W/m2 surface).

- Latent heat flux is created as solar radiation heats ocean surfaces, causing vaporization. 
- Vaporization then cools ocean surfaces as ""latent heat"" and water vapor are transferred to the atmosphere.
- This process creates clouds and rain and upward air circulation and heats the atmosphere, and 
- the latent heat is transported by air currents to higher latitudes.

So latent heat flux transports solar radiation and water vapor from oceans to atmosphere and redistributes energy and water vapor. The amplitude of the latent heat flux process depends on the amount of solar radiation that reaches the ocean's surface, which again dependens on atmosphere albedo, clouds and aresols. Latent heat flux is fundamental in cloud formation and is proportional to surface wind speeds, both potential feedback loops. The effects on climate to a hypothetical change in latent heat flux is shown to be quite significant in [simulations](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/water-water-everywhere.html).

Latent heat flux **increased 10% or about 9 W/m2** from 1980 to 2003 [\[fig\]](https://imgur.com/a/GqIe3q1) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-88-4-527) [\[ch3:fig6\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) and this is **attributed to ""natural variations"" in AR5** [\[ch3.4.2.2\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00148.1). The magnitude of the increase excludes CO2-downwelling as the cause (ΔF = ~5.35×ln (373/338) = 0.52 W/m2 before feedbacks).

Changes in **ocean heat content** are significant as
- bulk of earth emissions imbalance (difference between earth incoming and outgoing radiation) goes to ocean heating, due to ocean's large mass and heat capacity [\[ch3:box 3.1\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/), and as
- continental warming due to human activity is believed to be [80-90%](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051106#grl29030-bib-0009) dominated by indirect warming from oceans. 

Since 2003 the derivative of ocean heat content and the derivative of the earth emissions imbalance both appear to be declining \[[Fig15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331886058_Decadal_Changes_of_the_Reflected_Solar_Radiation_and_the_Earth_Energy_Imbalance)\], and this decline corresponds with the 2003 peak in latent heat flux. Ocean heat content, earth emissions imbalance and latent heat flux all indicate that the cause of the 1980-2003 anomaly has subsided.

**""Global brightening""** is one plausible theory for the heat flux anomaly, the shortwave (solar-)radiation reaching the surface appears to have increased significantly over the period [\[1983-2001\]](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=18825) due to changes in clouds or atmospheric aerosols.

**Since the period 1980-2003 has a 0.5-1 W/m2 expected increase in CO2-downwelling, and a 9 W/m2 measured increase in latent heat flux due to ""natural variation"", much of the warming in this period must also be due to natural variation. Logically, this could have occurred in one of two ways:** 
- **increases in temperature and latent heat flux have a common cause, such as ""global brightening"", or** 
- **latent heat flux increase, what ever its cause, caused the surface warming.**

____

**Significance**

Paleosols (ancient soils) have been used to estimate CO2 concentrations during the Archean Eon, 4.0 to 2.5 Ga. However, different paleosol studies disagree with each other and with climate model estimates for ancient CO2 levels. Oxidized iron micrometeorites dated at 2.7 Ga represent a new CO2 proxy with which to compare. These meteorites suggest that CO2 constituted 25 to 50% of the atmosphere at that time. This is easiest to explain if the N2 partial pressure was lower than today so that the atmospheric greenhouse effect was modest and the climate was cool, consistent with evidence for contemporaneous glaciation.

**Abstract**

Tomkins et al. [A. G. Tomkins et al., Nature 533, 235–238 (2016)] suggested that iron oxides contained in 2.7-Ga iron micrometeorites can be used to determine the concentration of O2 in the Archean upper atmosphere. Specifically, they argued that the presence of magnetite in these objects implies that O2 must have been near present-day levels (∼21%) within the altitude range where the micrometeorites were melted during entry. Here, we reevaluate their data using a 1D photochemical model. We find that atomic oxygen, O, is the most abundant strong oxidant in the upper atmosphere, rather than O2. But data from shock tube experiments suggest that CO2 itself may also serve as the oxidant, in which case micrometeorite oxidation really constrains the CO2/N2 ratio, not the total oxidant abundance. For an atmosphere containing 0.8 bar of N2, like today, the lower limit on the CO2 mixing ratio is ∼0.23. This would produce a mean surface temperature of ∼300 K at 2.7 Ga, which may be too high, given evidence for glaciation at roughly this time. If pN2 was half the present value, and warming by other greenhouse gases like methane was not a major factor, the mean surface temperature would drop to ∼291 K, consistent with glaciation. This suggests that surface pressure in the Neoarchean may need to have been lower—closer to 0.6 bar—for CO2 to have oxidized the micrometeorites. Ultimately, iron micrometeorites may be an indicator for ancient atmospheric CO2 and surface pressure; and could help resolve discrepancies between climate models and existing CO2 proxies such as paleosols.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

Latent heat flux **increased 10% or about 9 W/m2** from 1980 to 2003 [\[fig\]](https://imgur.com/a/GqIe3q1) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-88-4-527) [\[ch3:fig6\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) and this is **attributed to ""natural variations"" in AR5** [\[ch3.4.2.2\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00148.1). The magnitude of the increase excludes CO2-downwelling as the cause (ΔF = ~5.35×ln (373/338) = 0.52 W/m2 before feedbacks).

Changes in **ocean heat content** are significant as
- bulk of earth emissions imbalance (difference between earth incoming and outgoing radiation) goes to ocean heating, due to ocean's large mass and heat capacity [\[ch3:box 3.1\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/), and as
- continental warming due to human activity is believed to be [80-90%](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051106#grl29030-bib-0009) dominated by indirect warming from oceans. 

Since 2003 the derivative of ocean heat content and the derivative of the earth emissions imbalance both appear to be declining \[[Fig15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331886058_Decadal_Changes_of_the_Reflected_Solar_Radiation_and_the_Earth_Energy_Imbalance)\], and this decline corresponds with the 2003 peak in latent heat flux. Ocean heat content, earth emissions imbalance and latent heat flux all indicate that the cause of the 1980-2003 anomaly has subsided.

**""Global brightening""** is one plausible theory for the heat flux anomaly, the shortwave (solar-)radiation reaching the surface appears to have increased significantly over the period [\[1983-2001\]](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=18825) due to changes in clouds or atmospheric aerosols.

**Since the period 1980-2003 has a 0.5-1 W/m2 expected increase in CO2-downwelling, and a 9 W/m2 measured increase in latent heat flux due to ""natural variation"", much of the warming in this period must also be due to natural variation. Logically, this could have occurred in one of two ways:** 
- **increases in temperature and latent heat flux have a common cause, such as ""global brightening"", or** 
- **latent heat flux increase, what ever its cause, caused the surface warming.**

**Abstract**

Leads are a key feature of the Arctic ice pack during the winter owing to their substantial contribution to the surface energy balance. According to the present understanding, enhanced heat and moisture fluxes from high lead concentrations tend to produce more boundary layer clouds. However, described here in our composite analyses of diverse surface- and satellite-based observations, we find that abundant boundary layer clouds are associated with low lead flux periods, while fewer boundary layer clouds are observed for high lead flux periods. Motivated by these counterintuitive results, we conducted three-dimensional cloud-resolving simulations to investigate the underlying physics. We find that newly frozen leads with large sensible heat flux but low latent heat flux tend to dissipate low clouds. This finding indicates that the observed high lead fractions likely consist of mostly newly frozen leads that reduce any pre-existing low-level cloudiness, which in turn decreases downwelling infrared flux and accelerates the freezing of sea ice.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Climate change has broad ecological implications for species that rely on sensitive habitats. For some top predators, loss of habitat is expected to lead to cascading behavioral, nutritional, and reproductive changes that ultimately accelerate population declines. In the case of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), declining Arctic sea ice reduces access to prey and lengthens seasonal fasting periods. We used a novel combination of physical capture, biopsy darting, and visual aerial observation data to project reproductive performance for polar bears by linking sea ice loss to changes in habitat use, body condition (i.e., fatness), and cub production. Satellite telemetry data from 43 (1991–1997) and 38 (2009–2015) adult female polar bears in the Baffin Bay subpopulation showed that bears now spend an additional 30 d on land (90 d in total) in the 2000s compared to the 1990s, a change closely correlated with changes in spring sea ice breakup and fall sea ice formation. Body condition declined for all sex, age, and reproductive classes and was positively correlated with sea ice availability in the current and previous year. Furthermore, cub litter size was positively correlated with maternal condition and spring breakup date (i.e., later breakup leading to larger litters), and negatively correlated with the duration of the ice‐free period (i.e., longer ice‐free periods leading to smaller litters). Based on these relationships, we projected reproductive performance three polar bear generations into the future (approximately 35 yr). Results indicate that two‐cub litters, previously the norm, could largely disappear from Baffin Bay as sea ice loss continues. Our findings demonstrate how concurrent analysis of multiple data types collected over long periods from polar bears can provide a mechanistic understanding of the ecological implications of climate change. This information is needed for long‐term conservation planning, which includes quantitative harvest risk assessments that incorporate estimated or assumed trends in future environmental carrying capacity.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

This article presents a multi-model assessment of the macroeconomic impacts of coastal flooding due to sea level rise and the respective economy-wide implications of adaptation measures for two greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration targets, namely the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)2.6 and RCP4.5, and subsequent temperature increases. We combine our analysis, focusing on the global level, as well as on individual G20 countries, with the corresponding stylized RCP mitigation efforts in order to understand the implications of interactions across mitigation, adaptation and sea level rise on a macroeconomic level. Our global results indicate that until the middle of this century, differences in macroeconomic impacts between the two climatic scenarios are small, but increase substantially towards the end of the century. Moreover, direct economic impacts can be partially absorbed by substitution effects in production processes and via international trade effects until 2050. By 2100 however, we find that this dynamic no longer holds and economy-wide effects become even larger than direct impacts. The disturbances of mitigation efforts to the overall economy may in some regions and for some scenarios lead to a counterintuitive result, namely to GDP losses that are higher in RCP26 than in RCP45, despite higher direct coastal damages in the latter scenario. Within the G20, our results indicate that China, India and Canada will experience the highest macroeconomic impacts, in line with the respective direct climatic impacts, with the two first large economies undertaking the highest mitigation efforts in a cost-efficient global climate action. A sensitivity analysis of varying socioeconomic assumptions highlights the role of climate-resilient development as a crucial complement to mitigation and adaptation efforts.",Positive,Importance of human intervention

**Abstract**

The permafrost zone is expected to be a substantial carbon source to the atmosphere, yet large-scale models currently only simulate gradual changes in seasonally thawed soil. Abrupt thaw will probably occur in &lt;20% of the permafrost zone but could affect half of permafrost carbon through collapsing ground, rapid erosion and landslides. Here, we synthesize the best available information and develop inventory models to simulate abrupt thaw impacts on permafrost carbon balance. Emissions across 2.5 million km2 of abrupt thaw could provide a similar climate feedback as gradual thaw emissions from the entire 18 million km2 permafrost region under the warming projection of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. While models forecast that gradual thaw may lead to net ecosystem carbon uptake under projections of Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, abrupt thaw emissions are likely to offset this potential carbon sink. Active hillslope erosional features will occupy 3% of abrupt thaw terrain by 2300 but emit one-third of abrupt thaw carbon losses. Thaw lakes and wetlands are methane hot spots but their carbon release is partially offset by slowly regrowing vegetation. After considering abrupt thaw stabilization, lake drainage and soil carbon uptake by vegetation regrowth, we conclude that models considering only gradual permafrost thaw are substantially underestimating carbon emissions from thawing permafrost.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Anthropogenic land use and land cover changes (LULCC) have a large impact on the global terrestrial carbon sink, but this effect is not well characterized according to biogeographical region. Here, using state-of-the-art Earth observation data and a dynamic global vegetation model, we estimate the impact of LULCC on the contribution of biomes to the terrestrial carbon sink between 1992 and 2015. Tropical and boreal forests contributed equally, and with the largest share of the mean global terrestrial carbon sink. CO2 fertilization was found to be the main driver increasing the terrestrial carbon sink from 1992 to 2015, but the net effect of all drivers (CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition, LULCC and meteorological forcing) caused a reduction and an increase, respectively, in the terrestrial carbon sink for tropical and boreal forests. These diverging trends were not observed when applying a conventional LULCC dataset, but were also evident in satellite passive microwave estimates of aboveground biomass. These datasets thereby converge on the conclusion that LULCC have had a greater impact on tropical forests than previously estimated, causing an increase and decrease of the contributions of boreal and tropical forests, respectively, to the growing terrestrial carbon sink.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

Thanks for reading.",2020,1,Would Hydrogen fueled aircrafts be better or worse than kerosin fueled?,"So I think you haven't gotten a response yet because you're skipping over a very important conundrum, and folks are going to have a hard time addressing your secondary conclusion (the water vapor byproduct of hydrogen planes is better/worse than conventional planes) because it depends on the fate of the first problem.

This is the sentence that sticks:

&gt; while regular planes emit both water and co2, a hydrogen plane would emit probably more water into the stratosphere since water is the only chemical reaction product.

This is comparing apples to oranges.  The two are not comparable in isolation because in some cases there's more *embedded* energy in hydrogen fuel than there is in jet fuel.  Hydrogen takes energy to *produce* because it's an energy delivery and storage mechanism (and one with a low energy content by volume, mind you).  Fossil fuels, on the other hand, simply have to be burned because their energy content by volume is high.  Obviously they require energy to mine, and so an apples-to-apples comparison of the two from cradle to grave would be fairly complicated to assess, but you can't worry about the one-to-one byproduct comparison of their utilization in the sky without first addressing the CO2 that's produced when/if you burn conventional fuel to produce hydrogen in the first place.  The total carbon signature of a hydrogen plane *might* be less than a conventional plane (say if the hydrogen is produced using wind or solar energy), but it also might be more (if it's produced by burning natural gas or coal).  It also depends on whether the hydrogen was obtained from water or natural gas.  Both are possible, but most of what's already available is produced from natural gas, which makes a carbon footprint comparison pretty messy.

So as you can see, it's hard to disentangle the question about the fate of the cloud particles that precipitate from the produced water vapor if you can't even get a good handle on which fuel source is less carbon intensive per unit of energy.  Which means quantifying ""the effect on the climate"" of one or the other is nigh impossible.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

The Paris Climate Agreement aims to keep temperature rise well below 2 °C. This implies mitigation costs as well as avoided climate damages. Here we show that independent of the normative assumptions of inequality aversion and time preferences, the agreement constitutes the economically optimal policy pathway for the century. To this end we consistently incorporate a damage-cost curve reproducing the observed relation between temperature and economic growth into the integrated assessment model DICE. We thus provide an inter-temporally optimizing cost-benefit analysis of this century’s climate problem. We account for uncertainties regarding the damage curve, climate sensitivity, socioeconomic future, and mitigation costs. The resulting optimal temperature is robust as can be understood from the generic temperature-dependence of the mitigation costs and the level of damages inferred from the observed temperature-growth relationship. Our results show that the politically motivated Paris Climate Agreement also represents the economically favourable pathway, if carried out properly.",Positive,Undefined

________

**Abstract**

Under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, new controls are being implemented to reduce emissions of HFC-23 (CHF3), a by-product during the manufacture of HCFC-22 (CHClF^(2)). Starting in 2015, China and India, who dominate global HCFC-22 production (75% in 2017), set out ambitious programs to reduce HFC-23 emissions. Here, we estimate that these measures should have seen global emissions drop by 87% between 2014 and 2017. Instead, atmospheric observations show that emissions have increased and in 2018 were higher than at any point in history (15.9 ± 0.9 Gg yr^(−1)). Given the magnitude of the discrepancy between expected and observation-inferred emissions, it is likely that the reported reductions have not fully materialized or there may be substantial unreported production of HCFC-22, resulting in unaccounted-for HFC-23 by-product emissions. The difference between reported and observation-inferred estimates suggests that an additional ~309 Tg CO2-equivalent emissions were added to the atmosphere between 2015 and 2017.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Sea level rise in the United States will lead to large scale migration in the future. We propose a framework to examine future climate migration patterns using models of human migration. Our framework requires that we distinguish between historical versus climate driven migration and recognizes how the impacts of climate change can extend beyond the affected area. We apply our framework to simulate how migration, driven by sea level rise, differs from baseline migration patterns. Specifically, we couple a sea level rise model with a data-driven model of human migration and future population projections, creating a generalized joint model of climate driven migration that can be used to simulate population distributions under potential future sea level rise scenarios. The results of our case study suggest that the effects of sea level rise are pervasive, expanding beyond coastal areas via increased migration, and disproportionately affecting some areas of the United States.",Negative,Undefined

"*Can anyone here knowledgeable in climate science chime in and provide any feedback on why ""clear-sky"" studies like this can or can't be used in the manner described below? Any help much appreciated.*

The CO2 radiative forcing term is often modelled as

*Δ F=k ln(c/c0),*

where *k* in AR3 is *5.35* (page 358 in the ""WG1 physical basis"")*.*

Now in a 2015 Nature article by Feldmann *""Observational determination of surface radiative forcing by CO2 from 2000 to 2010""*, the radiative effect of CO2 was [observed](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14240) to be **0.2** **W/m2** over the decade for 2000-2010(see [Figure 4](https://imgur.com/a/OErknh0)), during which CO2 increased from 370ppm to 392 ppm.

This is 30% lower than what the IPCC model states:

*Δ F=5.35\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.309 W/m2.***

To approximate the result of the Nature article, the parameter  *k* should have been reduced to *\~3.6:*

*Δ F=3.6\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.207 W/m2***.

**Feldmann and co-authors appear to not have noticed or commented that the radiative forcing they found was low in their paper.**

ECS can be [split](https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/clip_image0022.jpg) into *pre-feedback climate sensitivity* and a *post-feedback gain factor,* and the radiative forcing of CO2 is a factor in pre-climate sensitivity.

**Thus a reduced radiative forcing estimate by 30% would mean that ECS estimates from IPCC models should be reduced by 30% as well.**

Any thoughts?",2020,1,Anthropogenic Climate Change Denialism in the College Classroom,"The three key points:

1. **It's us**: The basic physics behind global warming &amp; climate change are simple and well understood: greenhouse gases like CO2 act as an insulating blanket over the Earth, stopping heat radiation from escaping to space and increasing surface temperatures. We've known this for centuries. We can model it well. According to NASA (and my own work), we've been [accurately predicting the temperature changes due to global warming for over 30 years](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2943/study-confirms-climate-models-are-getting-future-warming-projections-right/).
2. **It's bad**: [According to the EPA, CO2 is a pollutant](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a-clean), just like any others (e.g. mercury, lead): dumping it into the environment causes harm. The harm is just a bit more indirect than some other pollutants: for example, CO2 emissions will increase temperature which will increase the frequency and duration of deadly (and expensive) heat waves. But that's no different than CFCs, which through a complicated set of chemical equations, deplete the stratosphere of ozone, which protects us from harmful UV rays.
3. **There's hope**: Just like most other kinds of pollution, the problem is easily fixable by: stopping to dump the pollutant into the environment and fixing the mess that we've made so far. Clean energy technologies work, they're price competitive, and they could feasibly replace the current global fossil-fuel dominated energy capacity (coal plants, natural gas plants, gasoline, jet fuel, etc). We can adapt to the ongoing climate impacts by doing things like building sea walls and installing more air conditioning in vulnerable areas, but adaptation only works for so long, which is why we also need to stop emitting greenhouse gases too.",Negative,Undefined

Any thoughts?",2020,1,Anthropogenic Climate Change Denialism in the College Classroom,"To start show them a plot of directly measured global temperatures, pretty much everyone has seen this plot and it's gotten to the point where even the most recalcitrant climate deniers have pivoted to, ""Okay it's getting warmer but it's definitely not due to us!""

If you can get them to at least accept that much you can delve a little deeper into the nature of the warming. When we do that we find several independent lines of evidence pointing to something more specific. The upper atmosphere is actually cooling while the lower atmosphere is getting hotter. Worldwide, nights are warming more quickly than days, decade after decade. Polar regions are warming more quickly than regions nearer the equator. Collectively, what these changes point to is a type of warming that is specifically caused by an increasingly insulating atmosphere (what many papers will refer to as an “enhanced greenhouse effect""). Unlike (for example) an increase in solar activity, this kind of warming is measurably more pronounced when and where the sun is not visible overhead but the ever-thickening blanket of our atmosphere’s greenhouse gases is still hanging on to the residual warmth.

An increasingly insulating atmosphere makes the uppermost levels of our atmosphere colder over time (less solar heat is bouncing out through the outermost layers), and likewise makes less infrared radiation escape to space (which is exactly what we measure with, for example, Earth-orbiting satellites).

In other words, the warming we are seeing is specifically tied to a change in the composition of our atmosphere that is making it hold on to more of the sun’s energy. Even though the amount of energy coming from the sun to Earth has not changed over the past five decades ( [see slide 15](https://imgur.com/NguDoNr) ), surface and lower atmosphere temperatures continue to rise because our atmosphere is becoming a better insulator to outgoing radiation.

So in every way we can possibly measure an increasingly insulating atmosphere, we measure it and we confirm that that is exactly what is happening right now. You rightly point out that this change could be natural, and there are many ways we can find out. As it turns out, the outgoing energy (that we measure to be decreasing over a surprisingly short time period) is decreasing specifically at CO2 absorption wavelengths (see e.g., [slide 10](https://imgur.com/NguDoNr) ) over time. So not only can we say that our atmosphere is becoming more insulating over time, we can say that it is doing so specifically because of CO2. (There are several other lines of evidence we could look into, but (slide 10)[https://imgur.com/NguDoNr] should be enough). This is a fact to the same extent that “it’s getting overall warmer” is a fact.

So is the CO2 increase natural? This question has also been thoroughly studied and conclusively answered. Nearly all of the recently added and continually rising CO2 in our atmosphere has the isotopic signature of burned fossil fuels (as opposed to e.g., volcanoes). This is totally consistent with our collective emissions of about 40 billion tonnes of CO2 gas per year (and rising), which is way more than what all volcanoes emit (around 0.3-2% of that amount).

Although science and rational argument are apolitical, and although there are a lot of misinformed people screaming nonsense about how “climate change is the apocalypse,” I think it’s fair to say that many right-wing sources try to present the arguments of climate science like this: “The Earth is warming. CO2 is increasing. Therefore, CO2 is causing warming.” That’s not a strong argument, as you know.

What climate science has effectively proved at this point is a bit more nuanced, along the lines of:

(1) We observe that radiation from sun to earth has been overall steady or very slightly decreasing over the past five decades, yet the amount of energy reflected from Earth back to space has been decreasing over that same period. In other words, we’re seeing clear evidence that our atmosphere is becoming more insulating, decade after decade. This change (less and less energy getting from Earth into space) is very clearly increasing every decade, at least since the beginning of the space age.

(2) Regarding the cause of this increasingly insulating atmosphere, a careful look at the space- and ground-based radiation spectra directly shows the increasing influence of carbon dioxide. For example, outgoing radiation (Earth to space) is decreasing especially at CO2 absorption wavelengths. It is an undeniable fact that we are witnessing an increasing “greenhouse effect” due to increasing CO2.

(3) Regarding the source of the increasing CO2, nearly all of the recently added and continually rising CO2 in our atmosphere has the isotopic signature of burned fossil fuels (as opposed to e.g., volcanoes). This is totally consistent with our collective emissions of about 40 billion tonnes of CO2 gas per year (and rising), which is way more than what all volcanoes emit (around 0.3-2% of that amount).

So, even though climate has changed naturally in the past and will continue to change in the future (with or without humans), the present day surge in CO2 in our atmosphere (about 40 billion tonnes added from burning fossil fuels per year) is, right now, causing a measurable and accelerating reduction in the amount of heat leaving our planet. The fact that this change is measurable over a single human lifetime is mind-blowing. It’s a blink of an eye in geological terms.

There are certainly flaws in future climate modelling, if the science were perfected we wouldn't be pumping so much money into programs through NASA, NSF, the DoD, etc., but the basic idea, that more CO2 in our atmosphere = more insulating atmosphere, is a fact. Short of the outside influence of some insanely rare event like a civilization-ending asteroid impact, we have every reason to think that adding more CO2 will increase the already-significant effect.

Maybe this will help, unfortunately climate change has become an anchor for identity politics. It is very difficult to get people to change their mind on it because it means admitting they have been duped. At the end of the day you can give them all of this and probably, at best, hope that you convince some people listening in who were previously on the fence. Which is worthwhile in and of itself!

I hope this helps, good luck!",Positive,Undefined

"I would like some clarification of the following claims if some of you could spare the time:

We are at a CO2 minimum for geological time scale. As in 99.9999% of Earth's history had more CO2 than present.

When the Earth had 3,000 ppm (About 7 times the total concentration of present) there was more diversity of life, large plants, larger trees, and thriving eco systems.

The Earth literally had an atmosphere primarily composed of CO2 for the first billion years of its history. Algae in the oceans formed and absorbed it and turned it into O2.

The entire history of industrial activity for humans we have gone from 280 ppm to ~410 ppm. So we haven't even seen a single doubling of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The most CO2 has been released in the last 20 years than previous decades, yet global temperatures stagnated. Meaning CO2 sensitivity is greatly out pace by natural factors such as the PDO cycle.

The Earth saw cooling for 3 decades during 1940 to 1970 even though we saw CO2 rising across the globe. This is part of the reason people feared an ""Ice Age"" (Glaciation period) for returning.

Warming is not equally distributive, and actually happens more so towards the poles. Meaning even if the ""average temperature"" goes up, if you're close to the equator you will see no temperature change. This also means large swathes of areas in Russia and Canada go from being Tundra to farmable land. As in more food for the entire planet.

Plant life grows better at higher CO2 concentrations. Ideally 500-600 ppm would be where we slow down, as that will lead to better agriculture.

A glaciation period (some would call an Ice Age, even though we are in one right now) would result in vast death across the globe. Some estimate nearly a billion people would die. Meaning we should hope we are warming the planet to avoid another glaciation period.

Sea level rise has been going on for 20,000 years. And it is not accelerating. The current rate of sea level rise is 1-2mm per year. Meaning by the time populations are displaced will be over centuries, not years or even decades. Meaning humans who are good at adapting will adapt without even realizing they are doing so.

**Abstract**

The rapid warming of the Arctic, perhaps the most striking evidence of climate change, is believed to have arisen from increases in atmospheric concentrations of GHGs since the Industrial Revolution. While the dominant role of carbon dioxide is undisputed, another important set of anthropogenic GHGs was also being emitted over the second half of the twentieth century: ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds, in addition to causing the ozone hole over Antarctica, have long been recognized as powerful GHGs. However, their contribution to Arctic warming has not been quantified. We do so here by analysing ensembles of climate model integrations specifically designed for this purpose, spanning the period 1955–2005 when atmospheric concentrations of ODS increased rapidly. We show that, when ODS are kept fixed, forced Arctic surface warming and forced sea-ice loss are only half as large as when ODS are allowed to increase. We also demonstrate that the large impact of ODS on the Arctic occurs primarily via direct radiative warming, not via ozone depletion. Our findings reveal a substantial contribution of ODS to recent Arctic warming, and highlight the importance of the Montreal Protocol as a major climate change-mitigation treaty.",Positive,Global stance

"I’ve been thinking about a mechanism to be clear on the extent of culpability for the Climate Crims.
A fairly simple formula should be the logical  way. It might take some effort and testing to develop, but should be straightforward enough.
I can think of 2 ways at the moment:

1. CO2 liability.

Everyone has some CO2 liability - recognising the legacy of this issue. We can say that going about your day to day life is a baseline negligence. But a number of people  have been much more maliciously, knowingly, or purposefully culpable. Those who have demonstrated ‘knowing culpability’ or higher get a CO2 emission liability assigned to them.
For example, Australia emits about 500m tons of CO2 per year. Scott Morrison as both a minister, cabinet member, and PM has directly influenced Australian policy, and has demonstrated high culpability (knowingly culpable).
Let’s say hypothetically there are 100 highly culpable people in Australia in the last 5 years. The calculation would be 500m x 5 / 100 = 25m tons of CO2 in 5 years. 
We might determine that every 2m tons of CO2 liability has a mandatory sentencing of 1 year, so Scott is looking at 12.5 years goal just from the last 5 years.

2. Monetary damages 

Here we’d look at measuring liability in percentage of costs for recovery and rehabilitation. So let’s say the current fires are accounted at $4b. Climate change has made these 25% more damaging than they would have been, so the climate liability is $1b. Australia’s contribution to climate change is 2%, so $20m. Divide by the same 100 culpable individuals above and Scott’s liability is $200,000. 
That might not sound like much, but remember this is 1 event in 1 country. Considering all costs, globally, this will add up very fast.

Personally I prefer option 1. The number is a proxy - Scott hasn’t personally emitted 25m tons of CO2, but has been responsible for influencing the emissions of an entire country. The numbers are a ‘scorecard’ if you like, a way of measuring and apportioning liability.

The second way is a bit less abstract - using money as a score card means we’ll spend a long time quibbling if Scott is responsible for  $256,000 or $278,000 in the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef tourism income for example.

Using method 1 as a quantifiable measure of guilt for criminal action makes sense to me. You still need to prove the guilt, then the method apportions liability to guide the sentencing.
Method 2 would still be useful if people want to pursue civil liability too perhaps. 

What do you all think?",2020,1,Assigning and measuring culpability,"The problem with this is that you have to apply all the costs of either action. 

Supposing we banned fossil fuels tomorow, what would happen to the forests?

Considering that active deforestation for cooking fuel is a major cause of habitat loss, the cost of this has to be applied. 

And the external costs and benefits have to be applied. Whilst CO2 impacts climate, and this can have costs, it can also have benefits. The primary one is that crops need less water in arid climates and are less sensitive to heat and water stress. This may have a net benefit on human mortality in some parts of the world. 

The idea that fossil fuels have no benefits, for example they play a definite role in the reduction of people in extreme poverty over the last few decades, they reduce pressure on forests for wood for cooking, they have contributed to higher agricultural yields per hectare, which in turn reduces pressure on primary virgin habitats, it's not accurate to claim that they have only costs.

Moving forwards, we should end the subsidy on fosil fuels and promote renewables sure, but we have to do so in a rational way. 

There are all kinds of unexpected consequences that can occur. For example, native peoples in arctic regions used to kill whales primarily for the oil for cooking and heating. They have kerosene now, and so this an example of a relative benefit from having that fuel, so whale populations have recovered. Of course now we can go further, and make synthetic fuel from electrolysis using renewable power in the comming decades once the technology is ready.",Positive,Undefined

&gt;Models from France, the US Department of Energy, Britain's Met Office and Canada show climate sensitivity of 4.9C, 5.3C, 5.5C and 5.6C respectively, Zelinka said.

That's a lot higher than previous... How does that change our future outlook?",2020,1,Is Climate sensitivity much higher than anticipated?,"The exact amount of doubling and how much warming X value of CO2 would bring is unknown(again, estimations, not certainties). What I wanted to say is, that if all industrial civilizations somehow instantly stopped, we'd get a 1.3\*C increase from aerosols falling off, based upon the IPCC estimations. Now, we emitted some more CO2 and other greenhouse gases, so uncertiantiy remains.

I'm no scientist and only go off from what I think and could gather from comparison as the most likely value.

If you want to, I have the most simpelton math here, which...somewhat makes sense.

If the current amount of CO2 in ppm(400), brings us either 1-2\*C based upon past climate reconstructions or 3-4\*C also based upon past climate reconstructions, you can do math for both.

My base argument comes from the amount of warming the PETM experienced, as the sun wasn't that much brighter 56 million years ago.

PETM CO2 estimations: 840 ppm, 1680 ppm and 2500 ppm [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265911945\_The\_Paleocene-Eocene\_Thermal\_Maximum\_How\_much\_carbon\_is\_enough](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265911945_The_Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum_How_much_carbon_is_enough)

Now, lets do the math:

400 ppm= 2\*C, 400 ppm times 2= 800 ppm= 4\*C

800 ppm times 2= 1,600 ppm= 8\*C.

That would be in line with the middle value and the high end estimation for PETM warming.

400 ppm=4\*C,400 ppm times 2=800 ppm=8\*C.

So, both low end values work from a simpelton perspective. As we could hit  800 ppm by the end of this century and that the IPCC estimates a 4\*C temperature rise, it could be in line with my simpleton math. However, as demonstrated, the lower end value might work as well and if so, then we are in deep trouble.

"I’ve been thinking about a mechanism to be clear on the extent of culpability for the Climate Crims.
A fairly simple formula should be the logical  way. It might take some effort and testing to develop, but should be straightforward enough.
I can think of 2 ways at the moment:

1. CO2 liability.

Everyone has some CO2 liability - recognising the legacy of this issue. We can say that going about your day to day life is a baseline negligence. But a number of people  have been much more maliciously, knowingly, or purposefully culpable. Those who have demonstrated ‘knowing culpability’ or higher get a CO2 emission liability assigned to them.
For example, Australia emits about 500m tons of CO2 per year. Scott Morrison as both a minister, cabinet member, and PM has directly influenced Australian policy, and has demonstrated high culpability (knowingly culpable).
Let’s say hypothetically there are 100 highly culpable people in Australia in the last 5 years. The calculation would be 500m x 5 / 100 = 25m tons of CO2 in 5 years. 
We might determine that every 2m tons of CO2 liability has a mandatory sentencing of 1 year, so Scott is looking at 12.5 years goal just from the last 5 years.

2. Monetary damages 

Here we’d look at measuring liability in percentage of costs for recovery and rehabilitation. So let’s say the current fires are accounted at $4b. Climate change has made these 25% more damaging than they would have been, so the climate liability is $1b. Australia’s contribution to climate change is 2%, so $20m. Divide by the same 100 culpable individuals above and Scott’s liability is $200,000. 
That might not sound like much, but remember this is 1 event in 1 country. Considering all costs, globally, this will add up very fast.

Personally I prefer option 1. The number is a proxy - Scott hasn’t personally emitted 25m tons of CO2, but has been responsible for influencing the emissions of an entire country. The numbers are a ‘scorecard’ if you like, a way of measuring and apportioning liability.

The second way is a bit less abstract - using money as a score card means we’ll spend a long time quibbling if Scott is responsible for  $256,000 or $278,000 in the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef tourism income for example.

Using method 1 as a quantifiable measure of guilt for criminal action makes sense to me. You still need to prove the guilt, then the method apportions liability to guide the sentencing.
Method 2 would still be useful if people want to pursue civil liability too perhaps.

,2020,1,Climate Change Increases the Risk of Wildfires | Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,"This is a review of 57 scientific articles on the impact of climate change on wildfires that have been published since the last IPCC assessment report.

Summary:

&gt; Human-induced climate change promotes the conditions on which wildfires depend, enhancing their likelihood and challenging suppression efforts. Human-induced warming has already led to a global increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather, increasing the risks of wildfire. This signal has emerged from natural variability in many regions, including the western US and Canada, southern Europe, Scandinavia and Amazonia. Human-induced warming is also increasing fire risks in other regions, including Siberia and Australia. Nonetheless, wildfire activity is determined by a range of other factors including land management and ignition sources, and on the global-scale most datasets indicate a reduction in burned area in recent years, chiefly due to clearing of natural land for agriculture.

Since Australia has been in the spotlight recently, here is what the paper says about it:

&gt; Australia. Observational   data   suggest   that   fire   weather   extremes   are   already   becoming   more   frequent   and   intense   (Dowdy,   2018;   Head   et   al.,   2014).   However,   the   divergence   between   anthropogenic   and   natural   forcing   signals  is  weaker,  and  more  challenging  to  diagnose  than  in  other  regions,  due  to  strong  regional  and  inter-annual  variability  in  the  effect  of  the  El  Niño–Southern  Oscillation  on  fire  weather  (Dowdy,  2018;  Sharples  et  al.,  2016).  Other  important  regional  weather  patterns,  such  as  the  Indian  Ocean  Dipole  (IOD)  and  the  Southern  Annular  Mode  (SAM)  also  contribute  to  natural  variability  in  fire  weather,  but  their  effects  are  increasingly  superimposed  on  more  favourable  background  fire  weather  conditions.  Impacts  of  anthropogenic  climate  change  on  fire  weather  extremes  and   fire   season   length   are   projected   to   emerge   above   natural  variability  in  the  2040s  (Abatzoglou  et  al.,  2019).",Positive,Undefined

**Summary**

Many studies, including the EAT-Lancet Commission report, have argued that changing diets—in particular, shifting away from beef in favor of white meat and vegetables—can substantially reduce household carbon footprints (CFs). This argument implies that households with high CFs consume more meat than low-CF households. An observation of diet and CF across 60,000 households in Japan, a nation whose diet and demographics are in many ways globally indicative, does not support this. Meat consumption only weakly explains the difference between high- and low-CF households and is not localized to any particularly easily targeted group. We find that while nearly all households can reduce their CF by eating less meat, higher-CF households are not distinguished by excessive meat consumption relative to other households but rather have higher household CF intensity because of elevated consumption in other areas including restaurants, confectionery, and alcohol.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

The Rök runestone from central middle Sweden, dated to around 800 CE, is famous, among other things, for a supposed reference to the emperor Theodo­ric the Great. This study proposes instead that the inscription deals with an anxiety triggered by a son’s death and the fear of a new climate crisis similar to the catastrophic one after 536 CE. Combining perspectives and findings from semiotics, philology, archaeology, and history of religion, the study presents a completely new interpretation which follows a unified theme, showing how the monument can be understood in the socio-cultural and religious context of early Viking Age Scandinavia. The inscription consists, according to the pro­posed interpretation, of nine enigmatic questions. Five of the questions con­cern the sun, and four of them, it is argued, ask about issues related to the god Odin. A central finding is that there are relevant parallels to the inscription in early Scandinavian poetry, especially in the Eddic poem Vafþrúðnismál.",Positive,Global stance

Consider a saucepan of water placed on a gas stove. Although the flame has a temperature measured in hundreds of degrees C, the water takes a few minutes to reach boiling point. This simple analogy explains climate lag. The mass of the oceans is around 500 times that of the atmosphere. The time that it takes to warm up is measured in decades. Because of the difficulty in quantifying the rate at which the warm upper layers of the ocean mix with the cooler deeper waters, there is significant variation in estimates of climate lag. A paper by James Hansen and others [iii] estimates the time required for 60% of global warming to take place in response to increased emissions to be in the range of 25 to 50 years. The mid-point of this is 37.5 which I have rounded to 40 years.

"I’ve been thinking about a mechanism to be clear on the extent of culpability for the Climate Crims.
A fairly simple formula should be the logical  way. It might take some effort and testing to develop, but should be straightforward enough.
I can think of 2 ways at the moment:

1. CO2 liability.

Everyone has some CO2 liability - recognising the legacy of this issue. We can say that going about your day to day life is a baseline negligence. But a number of people  have been much more maliciously, knowingly, or purposefully culpable. Those who have demonstrated ‘knowing culpability’ or higher get a CO2 emission liability assigned to them.
For example, Australia emits about 500m tons of CO2 per year. Scott Morrison as both a minister, cabinet member, and PM has directly influenced Australian policy, and has demonstrated high culpability (knowingly culpable).
Let’s say hypothetically there are 100 highly culpable people in Australia in the last 5 years. The calculation would be 500m x 5 / 100 = 25m tons of CO2 in 5 years. 
We might determine that every 2m tons of CO2 liability has a mandatory sentencing of 1 year, so Scott is looking at 12.5 years goal just from the last 5 years.

2. Monetary damages 

Here we’d look at measuring liability in percentage of costs for recovery and rehabilitation. So let’s say the current fires are accounted at $4b. Climate change has made these 25% more damaging than they would have been, so the climate liability is $1b. Australia’s contribution to climate change is 2%, so $20m. Divide by the same 100 culpable individuals above and Scott’s liability is $200,000. 
That might not sound like much, but remember this is 1 event in 1 country. Considering all costs, globally, this will add up very fast.

Personally I prefer option 1. The number is a proxy - Scott hasn’t personally emitted 25m tons of CO2, but has been responsible for influencing the emissions of an entire country. The numbers are a ‘scorecard’ if you like, a way of measuring and apportioning liability.

The second way is a bit less abstract - using money as a score card means we’ll spend a long time quibbling if Scott is responsible for  $256,000 or $278,000 in the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef tourism income for example.

Using method 1 as a quantifiable measure of guilt for criminal action makes sense to me. You still need to prove the guilt, then the method apportions liability to guide the sentencing.

**Abstract**

Emissions of methane (CH4) from tropical ecosystems, and how they respond to changes in climate, represent one of the biggest uncertainties associated with the global CH4 budget. Historically, this has been due to the dearth of pan-tropical in situ measurements, which is particularly acute in Africa. By virtue of their superior spatial coverage, satellite observations of atmospheric CH4 columns can help to narrow down some of the uncertainties in the tropical CH4 emission budget. We use proxy column retrievals of atmospheric CH4 (XCH4) from the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and the nested version of the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry and transport model (0.5∘×0.625∘) to infer emissions from tropical Africa between 2010 and 2016. Proxy retrievals of XCH4 are less sensitive to scattering due to clouds and aerosol than full physics retrievals, but the method assumes that the global distribution of carbon dioxide (CO2) is known. We explore the sensitivity of inferred a posteriori emissions to this source of systematic error by using two different XCH4 data products that are determined using different model CO2 fields. We infer monthly emissions from GOSAT XCH4 data using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, allowing us to report seasonal cycles and trends in annual mean values. We find mean tropical African emissions between 2010 and 2016 range from 76 (74–78) to 80 (78–82) Tg yr−1, depending on the proxy XCH4 data used, with larger differences in Northern Hemisphere Africa than Southern Hemisphere Africa. We find a robust positive linear trend in tropical African CH4 emissions for our 7-year study period, with values of 1.5 (1.1–1.9) Tg yr−1 or 2.1 (1.7–2.5) Tg yr−1, depending on the CO2 data product used in the proxy retrieval. This linear emissions trend accounts for around a third of the global emissions growth rate during this period. A substantial portion of this increase is due to a short-term increase in emissions of 3 Tg yr−1 between 2011 and 2015 from the Sudd in South Sudan. Using satellite land surface temperature anomalies and altimetry data, we find this increase in CH4 emissions is consistent with an increase in wetland extent due to increased inflow from the White Nile, although the data indicate that the Sudd was anomalously dry at the start of our inversion period. We find a strong seasonality in emissions across Northern Hemisphere Africa, with the timing of the seasonal emissions peak coincident with the seasonal peak in ground water storage. In contrast, we find that a posteriori CH4 emissions from the wetland area of the Congo Basin are approximately constant throughout the year, consistent with less temporal variability in wetland extent, and significantly smaller than a priori estimates.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

"I’ve been thinking about a mechanism to be clear on the extent of culpability for the Climate Crims.
A fairly simple formula should be the logical  way. It might take some effort and testing to develop, but should be straightforward enough.
I can think of 2 ways at the moment:

1. CO2 liability.

Everyone has some CO2 liability - recognising the legacy of this issue. We can say that going about your day to day life is a baseline negligence. But a number of people  have been much more maliciously, knowingly, or purposefully culpable. Those who have demonstrated ‘knowing culpability’ or higher get a CO2 emission liability assigned to them.
For example, Australia emits about 500m tons of CO2 per year. Scott Morrison as both a minister, cabinet member, and PM has directly influenced Australian policy, and has demonstrated high culpability (knowingly culpable).
Let’s say hypothetically there are 100 highly culpable people in Australia in the last 5 years. The calculation would be 500m x 5 / 100 = 25m tons of CO2 in 5 years. 
We might determine that every 2m tons of CO2 liability has a mandatory sentencing of 1 year, so Scott is looking at 12.5 years goal just from the last 5 years.

2. Monetary damages 

Here we’d look at measuring liability in percentage of costs for recovery and rehabilitation. So let’s say the current fires are accounted at $4b. Climate change has made these 25% more damaging than they would have been, so the climate liability is $1b. Australia’s contribution to climate change is 2%, so $20m. Divide by the same 100 culpable individuals above and Scott’s liability is $200,000. 
That might not sound like much, but remember this is 1 event in 1 country. Considering all costs, globally, this will add up very fast.

Personally I prefer option 1. The number is a proxy - Scott hasn’t personally emitted 25m tons of CO2, but has been responsible for influencing the emissions of an entire country. The numbers are a ‘scorecard’ if you like, a way of measuring and apportioning liability.

The second way is a bit less abstract - using money as a score card means we’ll spend a long time quibbling if Scott is responsible for  $256,000 or $278,000 in the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef tourism income for example.

Using method 1 as a quantifiable measure of guilt for criminal action makes sense to me. You still need to prove the guilt, then the method apportions liability to guide the sentencing.
Method 2 would still be useful if people want to pursue civil liability too perhaps.

Water vapor is part of the feedback component, and its concentration in the atmosphere is a function of temperature, so the warmer it gets, the more water will evaporate and the more water the atmosphere can hold. Water vapor can also act as a positive feedback here – the warmer it gets, the more water vapor there is in the atmosphere, which makes it warmer, and so on.

"I would like some clarification of the following claims if some of you could spare the time:

We are at a CO2 minimum for geological time scale. As in 99.9999% of Earth's history had more CO2 than present.

When the Earth had 3,000 ppm (About 7 times the total concentration of present) there was more diversity of life, large plants, larger trees, and thriving eco systems.

The Earth literally had an atmosphere primarily composed of CO2 for the first billion years of its history. Algae in the oceans formed and absorbed it and turned it into O2.

The entire history of industrial activity for humans we have gone from 280 ppm to ~410 ppm. So we haven't even seen a single doubling of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The most CO2 has been released in the last 20 years than previous decades, yet global temperatures stagnated. Meaning CO2 sensitivity is greatly out pace by natural factors such as the PDO cycle.

The Earth saw cooling for 3 decades during 1940 to 1970 even though we saw CO2 rising across the globe. This is part of the reason people feared an ""Ice Age"" (Glaciation period) for returning.

Warming is not equally distributive, and actually happens more so towards the poles. Meaning even if the ""average temperature"" goes up, if you're close to the equator you will see no temperature change. This also means large swathes of areas in Russia and Canada go from being Tundra to farmable land. As in more food for the entire planet.

Plant life grows better at higher CO2 concentrations. Ideally 500-600 ppm would be where we slow down, as that will lead to better agriculture.

A glaciation period (some would call an Ice Age, even though we are in one right now) would result in vast death across the globe. Some estimate nearly a billion people would die. Meaning we should hope we are warming the planet to avoid another glaciation period.

Sea level rise has been going on for 20,000 years. And it is not accelerating. The current rate of sea level rise is 1-2mm per year. Meaning by the time populations are displaced will be over centuries, not years or even decades. Meaning humans who are good at adapting will adapt without even realizing they are doing so.

Climate change is a hot topic right now, which I am personally happy about. Talking about climate change also means talking about the future; a future where we live in a world with advanced tech and less pollution. This doesn't have to be an argument. In fact, as a happy consequence of addressing the climate crisis, everyone's quality of life will (must) improve. 

It's ok to ask questions and I would implore you to do your own research and learn about the topic from a credible source as opposed to people on reddit, myself included! But I will do my best to give you accurate information. I anticipate my peers in this sub will be fact checking me anyway.

There are a lot of moving parts to the climate crisis. Science (including bad science / pseudo-science), engineering, politics, ethics, energy, pollution, ecosystem restoration, new tech, carbon sequestration (capture), poverty, history, life, death, posterity, and my field of study, the weather! It's indescribably complex, and I would be surprised if you (or anyone else) wasn't completely overwhelmed by the scope of work required to fix this shit storm (that's a technical term, you see lol). 

This is why it's so important, now more than ever, that we are open to working together. It's painfully clear that this can not be solved by one person, or even a small group of people, but rather a collective global effort. 

Read my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a9v9st/elon_musk_we_know_well_run_out_of_dead_dinosaurs/ecn0jdc/). I stress the importance of overcoming our biggest obstacle when it comes to addressing climate change: ourselves. 

**Moving on.**

I wanted to discuss another item in your post: Why is 2° such a big deal?

All ecosystems on Earth function around this amazing molecule known as H2O. [It truly is amazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water)! Water expands when it freezes, it has a high heat capacity (stores heat), it exists in all three phases (solid, liquid, gas) naturally on Earth, and it is critical to the existence of life. Water is so freaking cool, I've dedicated my entire life to studying what it does in our atmosphere. 

Many climates beyond the +/- 50° parallel balance at the freezing point of water and rely heavily on the annual cycle of freezing and melting. During the warm months, water is in it's liquid phase. During the cold months, water freezes into it's ice phase. While a degree or two in the tropics would go unnoticed, [the higher latitudes are dramatically impacted](https://skepticalscience.com/Arctic-sea-ice-melt-natural-or-man-made.htm). One or two degrees warming means ice freezes later in the year and starts melting earlier. This sets off a series of [positive feedback loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) that have both local and global consequences. 

Some consequences include an [immediate threat to wild life](https://skepticalscience.com/polar-bears-global-warming.htm), [melting permafrost releases methane](https://skepticalscience.com/methane-and-global-warming.htm), [melting glaciers](https://skepticalscience.com/himalayan-glaciers-growing.htm), [above freezing temperatures allow insects to proliferate and migrate to new areas](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/insect-disturbance-and-climate-change), [enormous wildfires caused by beetle kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Fort_McMurray_wildfire), [reduced albedo](https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/education/pbs_modules/lesson2Engage/), and so on.

These are just *some* of the problems we are facing today in the *polar regions* from just ~1.5°C. The warming we're experiencing impacts all ecosystems on Earth; land, sea, and sky. 

So what now? I write about what you can start doing [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9mb5q8/climate_report_scientists_politely_urge_act_now/e7dsbub/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/92uxy5/new_report_documents_corporate_medias_widespread/e39cqdw/).

Apologies for the snap judgment - a frequent way that some folks (who may not be engaging in the discussion in good faith) try to attack the discourse here is with a ""Gish Gallop"" - a set of questions or statements which on their face may seem to gel together, but logically don't necessary follow (or may be flawed or just too numerous to debunk/correct in detail).

At a high level, the argument weaves a few incorrect assertions into a set of statements which are really a red herring. For instance, the opening statements are more or less irrelevant when we consider contemporary climate change. So what if CO2 was much higher in the past? The original  author conveniently omits the fact that in the geological record, historical CO2 levels strongly correlate with sea level estimates (think about it - a warmer world, less glacial ice, higher sea levels). But this is silly; you can't directly compare geological climates with the present day one because (a) orbital characteristics strongly dominate geological climate patterns and (b) so too does the configuration of the continents. It's a wholly misleading way to look at the story.

A few other critical factual mis-statements:

1. No one seriously feared an ""ice age"" in the 1970's (e.g. [here](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1)), and the ones that *did* were concerned with massive increases in the emissions of aerosol/air pollution - which **does** noticeably cool the climate
2. Just because a place gets warmer doesn't mean it could become arable - for instance, vast swaths of the Russian and Canadian tundra get extremely little precipitation, and a wholly different balance of direct/diffuse radiation, so there is no reason to expect without other details that they'd become a new ""bread basket"" of the world.
3. To go along with it, yes - it's true that under **ideal, controlled settings**, increasing CO2 can increase plant productivity - but those idealized settings also include abundance of nutrients, water, and other resources which may become scarcer under climate change in a given region.
4. Finally, there is no threat for a glaciation on the timescale of human civilization. Yes, it *would* be bad if global temperatures dropped 10 degrees and an Ice Age occurred. But it ain't gonna happen, so what's the author's point?

**Abstract**

For generations, climate scientists have educated the public that ‘weather is not climate’, and climate change has been framed as the change in the distribution of weather that slowly emerges from large variability over decades. However, weather when considered globally is now in uncharted territory. Here we show that on the basis of a single day of globally observed temperature and moisture, we detect the fingerprint of externally driven climate change, and conclude that Earth as a whole is warming. Our detection approach invokes statistical learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the relationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and humidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global mean temperature or Earth’s energy imbalance. Observations are projected onto this relationship to detect climate change. The fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data. Detection is robust even when ignoring the long-term global warming trend. This complements traditional climate change detection, but also opens broader perspectives for the communication of regional weather events, modifying the climate change narrative: while changes in weather locally are emerging over decades, global climate change is now detected instantaneously.",Negative,Undefined

Some key takeaways from the executive summary:

&gt;A key finding of this study is that an increase in fire-weather risk is likely at most sites in 2020 and 2050, including the average number of days when the FFDI rating is very high or extreme. The combined frequencies of days with very high and extreme FFDI ratings are likely to increase 4-25% by 2020 and 15-70% by 2050. For example, the FFDI results indicate that Canberra is likely to have an annual average of 25.6-28.6 very high or extreme fire danger days by 2020 and 27.9-38.3 days by 2050, compared to a present average of 23.1 days. The increase in fire-weather risk is generally largest inland. Tasmania is likely to be relatively unaffected. The study also indicates that the window available for prescribed burning may shift and narrow. It is likely that higher fire-weather risk in spring, summer and autumn will increasingly shift periods suitable for prescribed burning toward winter.",Positive,Global stance

"I would like some clarification of the following claims if some of you could spare the time:

We are at a CO2 minimum for geological time scale. As in 99.9999% of Earth's history had more CO2 than present.

When the Earth had 3,000 ppm (About 7 times the total concentration of present) there was more diversity of life, large plants, larger trees, and thriving eco systems.

The Earth literally had an atmosphere primarily composed of CO2 for the first billion years of its history. Algae in the oceans formed and absorbed it and turned it into O2.

The entire history of industrial activity for humans we have gone from 280 ppm to ~410 ppm. So we haven't even seen a single doubling of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The most CO2 has been released in the last 20 years than previous decades, yet global temperatures stagnated. Meaning CO2 sensitivity is greatly out pace by natural factors such as the PDO cycle.

The Earth saw cooling for 3 decades during 1940 to 1970 even though we saw CO2 rising across the globe. This is part of the reason people feared an ""Ice Age"" (Glaciation period) for returning.

Warming is not equally distributive, and actually happens more so towards the poles. Meaning even if the ""average temperature"" goes up, if you're close to the equator you will see no temperature change. This also means large swathes of areas in Russia and Canada go from being Tundra to farmable land. As in more food for the entire planet.

Plant life grows better at higher CO2 concentrations. Ideally 500-600 ppm would be where we slow down, as that will lead to better agriculture.

A glaciation period (some would call an Ice Age, even though we are in one right now) would result in vast death across the globe. Some estimate nearly a billion people would die. Meaning we should hope we are warming the planet to avoid another glaciation period.

Sea level rise has been going on for 20,000 years. And it is not accelerating. The current rate of sea level rise is 1-2mm per year. Meaning by the time populations are displaced will be over centuries, not years or even decades. Meaning humans who are good at adapting will adapt without even realizing they are doing so.

I am from Australia and I have a fair few people on my Facebook feed who are climate change deniers, and I would love some fodder for when they post their denialist garbage. 

As said, no climate scientist, but usually in the cooler months Australia does “back burning” where a lot of the built up flora is burnt off in controlled burns so there is less for summer. This is done in winter obviously because it’s less risk.

The season where this is possible however was significantly shorter this year, with hotter, drier conditions much earlier, meaning that back burning couldn’t be safely carried out, so when the fire season began (very early, in September), there was already a lot of dry, combustible material after quite a dry winter. So as conditions became rapidly hotter, and drier still (many areas in drought), the fires became massive and out of control. Then when large enough, they start influencing the weather themselves

"I would like some clarification of the following claims if some of you could spare the time:

We are at a CO2 minimum for geological time scale. As in 99.9999% of Earth's history had more CO2 than present.

When the Earth had 3,000 ppm (About 7 times the total concentration of present) there was more diversity of life, large plants, larger trees, and thriving eco systems.

The Earth literally had an atmosphere primarily composed of CO2 for the first billion years of its history. Algae in the oceans formed and absorbed it and turned it into O2.

The entire history of industrial activity for humans we have gone from 280 ppm to ~410 ppm. So we haven't even seen a single doubling of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The most CO2 has been released in the last 20 years than previous decades, yet global temperatures stagnated. Meaning CO2 sensitivity is greatly out pace by natural factors such as the PDO cycle.

The Earth saw cooling for 3 decades during 1940 to 1970 even though we saw CO2 rising across the globe. This is part of the reason people feared an ""Ice Age"" (Glaciation period) for returning.

Warming is not equally distributive, and actually happens more so towards the poles. Meaning even if the ""average temperature"" goes up, if you're close to the equator you will see no temperature change. This also means large swathes of areas in Russia and Canada go from being Tundra to farmable land. As in more food for the entire planet.

Plant life grows better at higher CO2 concentrations. Ideally 500-600 ppm would be where we slow down, as that will lead to better agriculture.

A glaciation period (some would call an Ice Age, even though we are in one right now) would result in vast death across the globe. Some estimate nearly a billion people would die. Meaning we should hope we are warming the planet to avoid another glaciation period.

Sea level rise has been going on for 20,000 years. And it is not accelerating. The current rate of sea level rise is 1-2mm per year. Meaning by the time populations are displaced will be over centuries, not years or even decades. Meaning humans who are good at adapting will adapt without even realizing they are doing so.

This source should make a lot clear: [tree of life](https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer). Tldr: for a long time in earths history (from 4000 million years ago to 1500 million years ago) as you also claim, the earths atmosphere was full of co2, nitrogen, methane etc, and a lot of life forms existed, but these are bacteria, archaea, and protists. So yes there was some biodiversity, but is this relevant to current life? Not really. 

Only after this plants evolved and added oxygen to the atmosphere which made it possible for current life to exist. This cut from the same data shows the life that is relevant to us, starting from about 700 million years ago: [history of life](https://i.imgur.com/RkuY1SS.png)...

But i think your first couple of points have to do with biodiversity and not really with climate change. I think nobody is arguing that CO2 is some kind of monster gas that is killing us all, we even breathe it out ourselves. The problem is that in the current atmosphere, we have a delicate balance where co2 regulates how warm the planet is (like a gas blanket) through radiative forcing of sun rays, and that balance is very fast being tipped towards a situation where we wont be able to live in the comfort we have for the past (ten?) thousand years orso, because 9f the industrial emission of CO2.

Climate change is concerning because co2 concentration is rising faster than it ever has and too quickly for adaptation of individual species. Past concentrations on geological time scales are irrelevant because life was adapted to a completely different atmosphere.

2. While co2 is necessary for plants to grow, the effects of desertification and fires from elevated temperatures and modal precipititation changes creates a net loss in bio-efficiency for many of the world’s largest biospheres.

3. 1940-1970 was not a “mini ice age”, it was just a climate cycle that underwent relatively slow global warming. The larger the window taken, the better data you get (+1 degree C from 1860-now)

"I would like some clarification of the following claims if some of you could spare the time:

We are at a CO2 minimum for geological time scale. As in 99.9999% of Earth's history had more CO2 than present.

When the Earth had 3,000 ppm (About 7 times the total concentration of present) there was more diversity of life, large plants, larger trees, and thriving eco systems.

The Earth literally had an atmosphere primarily composed of CO2 for the first billion years of its history. Algae in the oceans formed and absorbed it and turned it into O2.

The entire history of industrial activity for humans we have gone from 280 ppm to ~410 ppm. So we haven't even seen a single doubling of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The most CO2 has been released in the last 20 years than previous decades, yet global temperatures stagnated. Meaning CO2 sensitivity is greatly out pace by natural factors such as the PDO cycle.

The Earth saw cooling for 3 decades during 1940 to 1970 even though we saw CO2 rising across the globe. This is part of the reason people feared an ""Ice Age"" (Glaciation period) for returning.

Warming is not equally distributive, and actually happens more so towards the poles. Meaning even if the ""average temperature"" goes up, if you're close to the equator you will see no temperature change. This also means large swathes of areas in Russia and Canada go from being Tundra to farmable land. As in more food for the entire planet.

Plant life grows better at higher CO2 concentrations. Ideally 500-600 ppm would be where we slow down, as that will lead to better agriculture.

A glaciation period (some would call an Ice Age, even though we are in one right now) would result in vast death across the globe. Some estimate nearly a billion people would die. Meaning we should hope we are warming the planet to avoid another glaciation period.

Sea level rise has been going on for 20,000 years. And it is not accelerating. The current rate of sea level rise is 1-2mm per year. Meaning by the time populations are displaced will be over centuries, not years or even decades. Meaning humans who are good at adapting will adapt without even realizing they are doing so.

Additionally, I'm on mobile so I'm going to give you the tl;dr to the first grievance you mentioned. If you are still open to discussing, I can revisit this post tomorrow when I'm on my computer so I can format a proper response with citations. 

It's true, Earth has experienced wildly high concentrations of atmospheric CO2 in the past. Life indeed flourished during these periods. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations gradually rose and fell over millions of years by natural processes, allowing life (plants, animals, ecosystems, etc) ample time to adapt to a new climate. 

Today, however, atmospheric CO2 concentrations are climbing rapidly (nearly doubling in the last 200 years). As a result, various climates around the world are changing abruptly. Unfortunately, life on Earth is not able to adapt to these new conditions in such a short amount of time. 

It's important to remember that life is fragile and humans do not fully understand the way our ecosystems are connected and function. Hell, we're still discovering new life at the bottom of the sea! It would be a terrible delusion to assume humans can manage Earth's climate to our advantage with out grave consequences such as mass extinction.

**Abstract**

Equilibrium climate sensitivity, the global surface temperature response to CO$_2$ doubling, has been persistently uncertain. Recent consensus places it likely within 1.5‐4.5K. Global climate models (GCMs), which attempt to represent all relevant physical processes, provide the most direct means of estimating climate sensitivity via CO$_2$ quadrupling experiments. Here we show that the closely related effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), with values spanning 1.8‐5.6K across 27 GCMs and exceeding 4.5K in 10 of them. This (statistically insignificant) increase is primarily due to stronger positive cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo. Both of these are tied to the physical representation of clouds which in CMIP6 models lead to weaker responses of extratropical low cloud cover and water content to unforced variations in surface temperature. Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications.

**Plain Language Summary**

The severity of climate change is closely related to how much the Earth warms in response to greenhouse gas increases. Here we find that the temperature response to an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased substantially in the latest generation of global climate models. This is primarily because low cloud water content and coverage decrease more strongly with global warming, causing enhanced planetary absorption of sunlight ‐‐ an amplifying feedback that ultimately results in more warming. Differences in the physical representation of clouds in models drive this enhanced sensitivity relative to the previous generation of models. It is crucial to establish whether the latest models, which presumably represent the climate system better than their predecessors, are also providing a more realistic picture of future climate warming.

**Key Points**

- Climate sensitivity is larger on average in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 due mostly to a stronger positive low cloud feedback

- This is due to greater reductions in low cloud cover and weaker increases in low cloud water content, primarily in the extratropics

- These changes are related to model physics differences that are apparent in unforced climate variability

"Hi all, most of you have likely seen the satellite images of smoke from the fires, suffice to say these fires and their emissions are relatively large in scale. But I'm wondering if these might be comparable to a volcanic event, and if there will be effects on weather over the short term like you get when volcano's can reduce the level of solar energy reaching the planet surface. Also, are there any potential microclimate effects that might happen?",2020,1,Knock on effects of ash and smoke emissions from Aus and Brazil fires?,"It's worth quickly diving into that latitude effect, though, because it paints the bigger picture here and helps provide one pathway to go from ""local"" to ""global"" impacts.

The fact that very strong, explosive volcanic eruptions deposit material in the stratosphere is only half of the battle for them to impact global climate - they also need to occur at low latitudes, where circulations in the stratosphere can help distribute the sulfate broadly across the globe. A high-latitude, explosive volcanic eruption likely will not have the same effect as it would only cool one hemisphere - but it could still have important implications for the global hydrological cycle over the ensuing 1-3 years, even without the global temperature reduction we'd see from, say, another Pinatubo. 

It would be very interesting to look at global impacts from forest fire aerosol emissions via teleconnections; regional change in dynamics/circulation induced by the local enhancement to aerosol could impact monsoons or other patterns, possibly even having an ""action at a distance"" through dynamical teleconnections.

volcanoes has a very large vertical velocity compared to forest fires, and will bring their smoke up to higher altitudes. The higher the altitude -&gt; the longer the pollution lives, and thereby has a larger climatic effect. 

A volcano has a potential strong cooling effect due to the sulfur dioxide it releases, which is a precursor to the highly reflective aerosol, sulfate. If a volcano is strong enough to spew sulfate into the stratosphere it can stay there and reflect incoming solar radiation for years (the normal lifetime in the troposphere for sulfate is 8 days).

An oscillation is a periodic variation around a central value (think of a sine wave). Decades ago, climate scientists began to discover all kinds of oscillations in climate &amp; weather phenomena. One of these oscillations is called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which describes how, for some decades, temperatures in the North Atlantic are warmer than usual, whereas other decades they are anomalously cooler (and vice versa for the South Atlantic). This is believed to be linked to changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns, which were in turn thought to be an inherent, fundamental part of Earth's climate system. I'm focusing on AMO because it's what I'm personally most familiar with, but there are analogous phenomena in the Pacific too.

Mann, one of the most prominent climate scientists, did a lot of work on these oscillations and contributed a great deal to our understanding. Here, however, he has come up with a new statistical technique to diagnose these ""oscillations"" in multiple climate model output and observational data. His results show that they aren't oscillatory (i.e., do not vary around a central value) and, moreover, are not significantly different from random variations that would be expected to occur in the data.

In Atlantic paleoceanography, AMO is invoked frequently to explain changes in ocean circulation, chemistry &amp; primary productivity inferred from geological records. Yet, we may have to rethink (or rephrase) some of our work on this front.",Positive,Undefined

&gt;(3) that global warming will not have any severe consequences?

&gt;(4) that we cannot stop global warming?

....however 4) is PRACTICALLY correct. Especially if you change it to: ""We cannot stop global warming from serverly impacting our current way of life.""

If you change it to ""We can slightly improve the possibility of continued human existence by radically altering our current way of life under mass industrialised capitalism"" it becomes more true.

Let's face it - we all know our addiction to production, and capitalism's desire to keep the (possible) toxic effects of production out of the consumers view, is what perpetuates global warming.

There should be a government website that allows you to look up products by brand and find out the processes, origins, excesses and environmental damage along the way.

The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), one of the best-studied paleoclimatic intervals, offers a prime opportunity to investigate how the climate system responds to changes in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the cryosphere. Previous work has sought to constrain the magnitude and pattern of glacial cooling from paleothermometers, but the uneven distribution of the proxies, as well as their uncertainties, has challenged the construction of a full-field view of the LGM climate state. Here, we combine a large collection of geochemical proxies for sea-surface temperature with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to produce a field reconstruction of LGM temperatures using data assimilation. The reconstruction is validated with withheld proxies as well as independent ice core and speleothem d18O measurements. Our assimilated product provides a precise constraint on global mean LGM cooling of -5.9˚C (-6.3 – -5.6˚C, 95% CI). Given assumptions concerning the radiative forcing of GHGs, ice sheets, and aerosols, this cooling **translates to an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3.2˚C (2.2 – 4.3˚C, 95% CI), a value that is higher than previous estimates and but consistent with the traditional consensus range of 2 – 4.5˚C.**",Positive,Undefined

Paleointensity and isotope data can be directly compared in the depth scale without any synchronization or uncertainty in age since they come from the same sedimentary record. The only necessary processing was a linear interpolation to the same depth that was achieved downsampling the higher resolution paleointensity data (Fig. 1). To test the possible correlation, we initially made scatter plots of B* and δ18O (Fig. 4) and performed a simple linear regression between paleomagnetic field intensity (as a proxy for GCR flux) and oxygen isotopes finding no significant correlations (R = 0.044 and R = 0.043 for benthic and planktonic data, respectively).

We further test the independence of B* and benthic δ18O, which reflects the glacial history over the surveyed time interval, using a 3 × 3 contingency table (Table 1). We applied a non-parametric Fisher's exact test that indicated data independency at the 95% confidence level.

More refined analysis were performed using spectral methods. We computed the spectral power and coherence between benthic δ18O and B* using the multi-taper method (Mann and Lees, 1996). Gaps in the δ18O and B* time series were filled using the algorithm described by (Kondrashov and Ghil, 2006). The power spectra of benthic δ18O and B* are compared in Fig. 5a, the spectral coherence in Fig. 5b. Results suggest that statistically significant correlation exist for a very limited range of frequency bands (Fig. 5b), which represent the 8% and 12% of the total variance of δ18O and B*, respectively. The number of frequencies that exceed the 95% confidence level (15 out of 257 frequencies) and the 99% confidence levels (5 out of 257 frequencies) are only slightly higher than the 12 and 2.5 expected, respectively, from statistical fluctuations hinting to an almost complete independency of the two time series.

Power spectra and coherence have been computed in the core-depth scale rather then time scale (Wade and Pälike, 2004). b and c) Cross-spectral analysis (spectral coherence and phase) of paleointensity versus oxygen isotope data benthic foraminifera. Both paleointensity and isotopic data were re-sampled at evenly space intervals of about 11 cm, power spectra and coherence was calculated using the MTM coherence method of (Mann and Lees, 1996) with 3 tapers and bandwidth parameter p = 2. Dashed and continuous horizontal lines represent the 95% and 99% confidence limits, respectively for non-zero coherency, gray bands marks frequencies at which significant coherence can be found.

Inspection of the phase angle (Fig. 5c) shows that significant correlating frequencies have a phase-lags corresponding or close to zero, with the exception of the single peak at 3.25 m^(−1).

However, the GCR-climate model predicts higher GCR fluxes, thus lower geomagnetic field intensity, favoring glacial conditions (Shaviv and Veizer, 2003), which would imply an anti-correlation with a phase angle of 180° between geomagnetic field intensity and oxygen isotopes. Hence, even the statistically significant correlation found in limited frequency bands does not support the hypothesis of a control of GCR on global climate on the investigated time scale (10^3–5 yr).

Similar conclusions can be extracted from the analysis of Wavelet Coherence of the δ18O and B* time series (Fig. 6), which evidences higher coherence on the same frequencies/periods as MTM, although a lower of components exceeds the 95% confidence limit. Importantly, Wavelet Coherence better details the intermittant nature of high coherence intervals for any periodicity and the phase relationships through the record. It is worth noticing that the only interval where the expected 180° antiphase is observed is confined to a short interval at ~178 mcd at a wavelength of 150 cm.

***6. Conclusions***

Comparison of the geomagnetic paleointensity and both benthic and planktonic foraminiferal d18O (as a proxy for paleoclimate) from the Oligocene ODP Site 1218 (Equatorial Pacific) show no significant correlation, suggesting a substantial independence of the two records. The analysis of phase-lag suggests that even the marginal correlation found by spectral coherence analysis cannot be ascribed to the putative GCR interaction with climate. Our results suggest that the hypothetical link between the geomagnetic field intensity and climate predicted by the CFR hypothesis is absent or below the threshold of the sensitivity and accuracy of the proxy - a few tenths of °C for δ18O considering analytical precision – hence providing evidences against a long-term (10^(3)–10^5 yrs) control of GCR on global climate.

***3. Paleointensity record***

For the purpose of this study we have computed the relative paleointensity (B*) of geomagnetic field in 43 u-channel samples (continuous subsamples of split cores) from ODP Site 1218. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was normalized by isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). ARM was imparted to the u-channel samples with a 0.05 mT bias field and a 100 mT peak alternating field. IRM was induced with a 100 mT impulse field. Both ARM and IRM were subsequently measured at 1 cm intervals and subjected to progressive alternating field demagnetization. The measurement spacing of 1 cm, and AF demagnetization peak fields were chosen accordingly to those previously used for the NRM demagnetization (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005).

Uniform magnetic properties were checked by inspecting the variability of ARM and IRM. Histograms with the distributions of ARM and IRM intensity, after a 20 mT AF demagnetization (Fig. 2a) show that 95% of samples are within a variability factor of about 4.2 for ARM and 5.8 for IRM, well below the limit suggested by (King et al., 1983). However, we adopted a conservative approach considering less reliable the samples comprised in the 0.25% tails of IRM and ARM intensity distributions and marked them appropriately in the paleointensity record. A further quality checks for the uniform magnetic grain-size along the sedimentary sequence was checked by the IRM/ARM ratio, which is remarkably constant along the whole sequence (Fig. 2b).

[Fig. 2.](https://i.imgur.com/FMcmdmI.jpg) a) Histograms of ARM and IRM intensity after AF demagnetization at 20 mT. Gray bands on the sides of the histograms indicate the 2.5% tails of the distributions, which have been considered as less reliable and removed from the record. b) The diagram of ARM vs IRM after AF demagnetization at 20 mT shows the constant magnetic properties of the sediments.

ARM and IRM were subject to stepwise alternating field demagnetization using the identical peak fields used in NRM demagnetization, then B* was computed by fitting a straight line between the NRM intensity and the normalizer intensity (Fig. 3) following an approach similar to that of the Arai plots (Tauxe, 1993). The angular coefficient of the best-fit line is taken as our best estimates B*.

[Fig. 3.](https://i.imgur.com/LlSZAFL.jpg) Pseudo-Arai plot for typical samples of the studied sections of ODP Site 1218. Sample code (e.g. 1218B-16H-2-69.0) follows the standard IODP labelling, i.e. site and hole-core-section-depth. A large correlation coefficient for the best-fit line between NRM and ARM is generally found in the for AF demagnetization field larger than 20 mT. The small offset of the best-fit line is interpreted as a consequence of a spurious magnetization acquired during NRM demagnetization, as described by (Lanci et al., 2005). Smaller dots represent the demagnetization path; larger dots represent NRM values.

and the correlation coefficient R is used to evaluate the goodness of fit, thus the quality of the data. To avoid an unwanted influence of soft component in the NRM, B* was calculated from the same alternating field demagnetization steps used for calculation of the ChRM directions, which ranges between 20 mT and 80 mT. We finally choose to use the ARM as normalizer for the relative paleointensity (B*) record, although very similar results were obtained using IRM, as shown in Fig. 1. The statistical independence between the normalizer (ARM) and B* have been positively tested at the 95% confidence level using a Fisher exact test (Agresti, 2007), on a 3 × 3 contingency table to ensure that the paleointensity record is not significantly influenced by lithology. The trend and the relative variability of our paleomagnetic results are comparable with the coeval relative paleointensity record from ODP Site 522 (Tauxe and Hartl, 1997).

The absolute value of the geomagnetic dipole moment is not essential to evaluate the variation of the shielding effect from GCR fluxes because of the linear dependence of rigidity cuf-off of cosmic rays and dipole moment (Störmer, 1930). However, we have rescaled the values of B* by dividing their average values by the 0.3–30 Ma average geomagnetic moment (Selkin and Tauxe, 2000) Compared to the data compilation (Guyodo and Valet, 1999) from the last 800 kyr (Sint800) when large climate changes occurred across glacial-interglacial cycles, the variability of the Oligocene rescaled paleointensity record is slightly larger (σ = 4.4 × 10^22 A m^2 compared to σ = 2.6 × 10^22 A m^2 for Sint800).

***4. Paleoclimatic record***

Cenozoic climate revealed by multiple stable isotope (δ18O and δ13C) records from oceanic sediments shows considerable variability reflecting longer-term (106 yr) and short-term (104–105 yr) global fluctuations of ice-volume and/or deep-sea temperatures, and global carbon budget (Zachos et al., 2001). A detailed record of climate variability during the Early Oligocene is available from deep-sea sediments recovered with Equatorial Pacific ODP Leg 199. The oxygen stable isotope record from the continuous sedimentary sequence of Site 1218 suggests that major glacial episodes, occurred at 29.16, 27.91, and 26.76 Ma (Wade and Pälike, 2004), providing evidence for a global climate change signal well above the “noise” introduced by potential problems related to the sensitivity and laboratory accuracy of the proxy. Large (50–65 m) glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations corresponds to these events (Kominz and Pekar, 2001). Remarkable fluctuations in the Carbon isotope record suggest that major changes in the global carbon cycle were associated to these episodes of climate change (Wade and Pälike, 2004). The benthic foraminiferal δ18O record from Site 1218 is comparable with data obtained elsewhere (e.g. Zachos et al., 2001) implying that observed changes reflect a global signal.

The stable isotope stratigraphy provided by (Wade and Pälike, 2004) for the stratigraphic interval between magnetochrons C9n and C11n.2n corresponding to ~26.4 Ma–30 Ma based on astrochronology, represents the most detailed record of both short- (&lt;0.5 Myr) and long-term (2–3 Myr) climate change during the Oligocene (Lear et al., 2004; Wade and Pälike, 2004). ODP Site 1218 offers the possibility of directly comparing a high resolution record of relative geomagnetic paleointensity fluctuations, that we use as proxy for changes in GCR flux, with such a record of global climate changes.

***Abstract***

Changes in Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) flux have been proposed by some as the main factor controlling Earth's climate. This hypothesis, which invokes enhanced formation of low clouds due to ionization of atmospheric aerosol by GCR flux as a control mechanism, implies that climate sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 levels is overestimated. Here we propose to test this conjecture by comparing a deep-time 3.6 million year–long (~30–26.4 million years ago) record of global climate changes with a proxy record of geomagnetic paleointensity fluctuations. At the time scale adopted for this study, the geomagnetic field intensity is the major controller of GCR reaching the Earth. We compare the records of paleointensity, as a proxy for GCR flux fluctuations, and a record of global climate showing that they are substantially independent. We conclude that, the putative role of GCR flux as a cause for medium to long term (10^(3–5) yr) changes in Earth's climate is not supported by evidence.

***1. Introduction***

Several studies have proposed a possible influence of variations in the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) flux on Earth's climate, on the basis of an observed correlation between the amount of (GCR) flux reaching the atmosphere and average cloud cover on decadal (Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997; Marsh and Svensmark, 2000) and weekly timescales (Svensmark et al., 2016). Yet, other studies found no evidence for such a GCR-cloud correlation and discussed the possibility that methodological differences lead to different results (e.g. Laken et al., 2012).

More recently, experimental testing of the direct influence of GCR on cloud formation through the CLOUD experiment provided evidence for a very weak direct influence of GCR on cloud formation (Pierce, 2017). Although that study did not entirely excluding the possibility of indirect mechanisms, i.e. through a control on the global electric circuit (Tinsley and Zhou, 2015) and/or on the concentration of ozone close to the tropopause (Krivolutsky and Repnev, 2012). Indeed, different authors have proposed a connection between periods of higher solar activity – thus lower GCR flux –, and warmer climate intervals over periods of 100–200 kyr (Sharma, 2002; Christl et al., 2004) and during the last millennia (Usoskin et al., 2005) suggesting that effects induced by cosmic rays may affect longer-term changes in terrestrial climate.

On longer time scale (10^(4–6) yr), GCR variations are influenced by processes external to the heliosphere such as interstellar environment changes (Yabushita and Allen, 1998) or galaxy spiral arm crossings (Shaviv, 2003). On these grounds, a correlation between cosmic ray fluxes, inferred from measurements in meteorites, and occurrence of glacial ages in the last 150 Myr, has been claimed as an unambiguous evidence for a control of GCR on climate (Shaviv, 2002; Shaviv, 2003). However, flaws in the handling of different physical data have been evidenced by (Laut, 2003).

One way to indirectly test their potential effect of on climate is by comparing lateral or temporal variations in the intensity of the geomagnetic field to atmospheric and/or climate conditions. The geomagnetic field, in fact, has a considerable shielding effect on GCR (Walker, 1979; Smart and Shea, 2009). In the modern era, the cut-off rigidity (particle momentum per unit charge) varies from 0 through slightly &lt;17 GV for particle vertical arrival direction (see also www.nmdb.eu).

A decrease in the geomagnetic field intensity of 10–20% of the present day value would cause an increase of the GCR flux on our planet by 90–70% (Wagner et al., 2000). For comparison, the integral GCR flux at 1 au varies by a factor of four, ranging from 4000 particles m-2 sr-1 s-1 at solar minimum through 1000 particles m-2 sr-1 s-1 at solar maximum (11-year solar cycle; Potgieter, 2013; Armano et al., 2019). During periods of negative solar polarity, when the global solar magnetic field (GSMF) lines of force emanate from the Sun South Pole, the flux of positively charged particles appears more modulated, up to 40% at 100 MeV n-1 at solar minimum, with respect to epochs of positive solar polarity (Boella et al., 2001; Grimani, 2004, Grimani, 2007). The same polarity of the Sun is observed every 22 years, on average.

The passage of interplanetary large-scale structures, such as high-speed solar wind streams and interplanetary counterparts of coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), cause short-term recurrent and non-recurrent GCR flux variations (of typical duration of &lt;1 month; Cane, 2000, Richardson, 2004). A particle detector flown on the European Space Agency LISA Pathfinder mission between 2016 and 2017 allowed for monitoring the percentage change of the GCR proton (p) and helium (He) count rate (proportional to p and He fluxes) during this period of time (Armano et al., 2018 and references therein) and found that p and He nuclei constitute 98% of the cosmic-ray bulk in particle numbers to the total number. In space and above 70 MeV n-1, the GCR flux presents recurrent percent variations with respect to individual monthly averaged values of up to ± 7%. These variations show the same periodicities of the solar rotation period and higher harmonics.

Forbush decreases, generated by the passage of ICMEs, account for non-recurrent sudden drops of the GCR flux ranging between a few% and tens of %. Neutron monitors (NMs) have continuously monitored secondary particle final products of primary cosmic-ray (with energies &gt;500 MeV n-1) interactions in the atmosphere (Cane, 2000 and references therein) since the early 1950s. In order to infer the GCR fluxes at the top of the atmosphere from NM data, nucleon observations and secondary particle production in the atmosphere are combined in the NM yield functions. NMs allow for a direct measurement of the GCR flux above effective energies (Ec) only. At energies &gt; Ec the NM counting rate is proportional to the GCR integral flux incident at the top of the atmosphere. Ec range from 11 to 12 GeV for polar NMs through &gt;30 GeV for equatorial stations (Gil et al., 2017). NM observations show sudden decreases in intensity &gt;10% only during strong Forbush decreases (see for instance Cane, 2000).

From these observations, it can be concluded that at low latitudes, where insolation is maximal, the shielding effect of the geomagnetic field overcomes the role of both short and long-term GCR flux variations that result effective below 10 GeV-1 n. Consequently, in geological archives, if a (detectable) GCR effect on climate exists, evidence should be found by comparing paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic intensity records (e.g. Kitaba et al., 2017). Here we test this hypothesis by comparing a 3.6 Myr-long record of oxygen stable isotope, − a well established proxy for global paleoclimate change (e.g. Zachos et al., 2001) -, and Earth magnetic field paleointensity - as a proxy for the shielding effect - from ODP Leg 199 Site 1218 (Equatorial Pacific) during the early Oligocene (~26.4–30 Ma). Paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic records are derived from the same sedimentary archive and can thus be compared directly without the otherwise unavoidable uncertainty in the age model.

***2. Material and methods***

ODP Site 1218 (8°53.378′N, 135°22.00′W, water depth of 4811 m) is located in the central tropical Pacific (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). The Pleistocene and Miocene sedimentary sequence at ODP Site 1218 comprise two main sedimentary units. The upper 59 m consists of a Pleistocene to Middle Miocene brown clay unit with some nannofossils and occasional barren intervals (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). This upper clay unit is mostly made of wind-blown dust, clays, and radiolarians, some of which were reworked from older outcropping sediment. Below this brown clay unit, from 59 to 242 m composite depth, the section comprises nannofossils ooze and chalk of Lower Miocene–Oligocene age, which are the sediments examined in this study.

The complete magnetic stratigraphy, including rock magnetic analysis, of sediments from ODP Site 1218 were reported in (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005). Relative paleointensities of the Miocene-Oligocene section (from 50 to 140 mcd) of site ODP 1218 were studied by Channell and Lanci (2014) who have shown detailed rock-magnetic analysis. The reliability of Miocene-Oligocene paleointensity from Site 1218 was tested by comparison with coeval sedimentary record from ODP Site 1090 and IODP Site U1334 (Channell and Lanci, 2014). The three records from equatorial Pacific to South Atlantic gave very similar results implying that observed relative paleointensity represent a global signal.

The portion of ODP Site 1218 examined in this paper range from about 130 m to 190 m core depth. The sediments are Oligocene in age and have magnetic properties virtually identical to the overlying Miocene sediments and share the same reliability of paleomagnetic measurements.

At ODP Site 1218, the magnetostratigraphy (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005) has successfully identified polarity reversals from the lower Pliocene to the lower and could be unambiguously correlated with the reference Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale providing a precise dating of the sequence. The studied portion of ODP Site 1218 is comprised within the top of chron C9n and the bottom of chron C11n.2n with only minor gaps due to sampling problems or core recovery breaches ([Fig. 1](https://i.imgur.com/iqjQr4M.jpg)).",Positive,Undefined

I initially thought that it was cold freshwater floating on top of warmer melt-sustaining water, but when I look at the history I find that the negative temperature anomaly seems to persist basically year-round.

___

**Significance**

Emissions from the fossil fuel industry are one of the major sources of atmospheric methane. Gas leakages due to accidents in the oil and gas sector can release large amounts of methane within short periods of time. Although these emissions are very challenging to monitor, satellite measurement platforms offer a promising approach by regularly scanning the entire globe. This study demonstrates this capability of satellite measurements by reporting atmospheric measurements of methane emission from a natural gas well blowout in Ohio in 2018. Assuming a constant emission rate during the whole event, we find the total methane emission from the 20-d blowout to be equivalent to a substantial fraction of the annual total anthropogenic emission of several European countries.

**Abstract**

Methane emissions due to accidents in the oil and natural gas sector are very challenging to monitor, and hence are seldom considered in emission inventories and reporting. One of the main reasons is the lack of measurements during such events. Here we report the detection of large methane emissions from a gas well blowout in Ohio during February to March 2018 in the total column methane measurements from the spaceborne Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). From these data, we derive a methane emission rate of 120 ± 32 metric tons per hour. This hourly emission rate is twice that of the widely reported Aliso Canyon event in California in 2015. Assuming the detected emission represents the average rate for the 20-d blowout period, we find the total methane emission from the well blowout is comparable to one-quarter of the entire state of Ohio’s reported annual oil and natural gas methane emission, or, alternatively, a substantial fraction of the annual anthropogenic methane emissions from several European countries. Our work demonstrates the strength and effectiveness of routine satellite measurements in detecting and quantifying greenhouse gas emission from unpredictable events. In this specific case, the magnitude of a relatively unknown yet extremely large accidental leakage was revealed using measurements of TROPOMI in its routine global survey, providing quantitative assessment of associated methane emissions.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

“The unavoidable conclusion is that whatever impact CO₂ emissions may have on the climate cannot have been detected in the past and cannot be detected now.”

____

**Abstract**

The Antarctic ice sheet has been losing mass over past decades through the accelerated flow of its glaciers, conditioned by ocean temperature and bed topography. Glaciers retreating along retrograde slopes (that is, the bed elevation drops in the inland direction) are potentially unstable, while subglacial ridges slow down the glacial retreat. Despite major advances in the mapping of subglacial bed topography, significant sectors of Antarctica remain poorly resolved and critical spatial details are missing. Here we present a novel, high-resolution and physically based description of Antarctic bed topography using mass conservation. Our results reveal previously unknown basal features with major implications for glacier response to climate change. For example, glaciers flowing across the Transantarctic Mountains are protected by broad, stabilizing ridges. Conversely, in the marine basin of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, we find retrograde slopes along Ninnis and Denman glaciers, with stabilizing slopes beneath Moscow University, Totten and Lambert glacier system, despite corrections in bed elevation of up to 1 km for the latter. This transformative description of bed topography redefines the high- and lower-risk sectors for rapid sea level rise from Antarctica; it will also significantly impact model projections of sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries.",Negative,Global stance

____

**Abstract**

In recent decades, the Greenland Ice Sheet has been a major contributor to global sea-level rise, and it is expected to be so in the future. Although increases in glacier flow and surface melting have been driven by oceanic and atmospheric warming, the degree and trajectory of today’s imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet’s volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. Although the ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 335 ± 62 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,800 ± 339 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.6 ± 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,971 ± 555 billion tonnes (52%) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,827 ± 538 billion tonnes (48%) of ice loss was due to increased glacier discharge, which rose from 41 ± 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 ± 25 billion tonnes per year since then. Between 2013 and 2017, the total rate of ice loss slowed to 217 ± 32 billion tonnes per year, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions and as ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbræ. Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the IPCC’s predicted rates for their high-end climate warming scenario, which forecast an additional 50 to 120 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 when compared to their central estimate.

Am I correct in thinking that the primary greenhouse warming mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- the molecule becomes more energetic and transfers it's energy to surrounding molecules via collisions 

And the secondary mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- after some time that molecule may emit an infrared photon as a result.  
- if the direction of emission is downwards then the photon will either strike another CO2 molecule, or strike the earth's surface, warming it.

Because the majority of layman's information sources only mention the second mechanism.  

Thanks",2019,12,Greenhouse warming mechanism,"Indeed as aClimateScientist mentioned, if you were to simply look at conduction, meaning the energy that is transferred between two objects/molecules that come into physical contact, a molecule of CO2 will have a much more higher chance of coming into contact with O2 or N2, as they are the primary elements in the lower atmosphere. Not necessarily peer reviewed, but a quick look on the internet allowed me to compare concentrations of O2, N2 and CO2 in terms of ppm ([http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/atmospheric-composition](http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/atmospheric-composition)). One can see that the amount of CO2 molecules is far lesser than that of the main two. In the eventually that CO2 does come into contact with another CO2 molecule, when evaluating the effectiveness of conduction, one must look at the thermal conductivity of the materials. In general, air is a poor conductor, but what about CO2 itself? Well, another quick look online ( [https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/carbon-dioxide-thermal-conductivity-temperature-pressure-d\_2019.html](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/carbon-dioxide-thermal-conductivity-temperature-pressure-d_2019.html) ) allowed me to find the thermal conductivity of CO2 gas at around 220K (-50C, which is somewhat the temperature we expect at the top of the troposphere) and we find a thermal conductivity of 0.0106 W/m K. On the other hand, air ( [https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-properties-viscosity-conductivity-heat-capacity-d\_1509.html](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-properties-viscosity-conductivity-heat-capacity-d_1509.html) ) has a thermal conductivity of 0.02041W/m K. This means that CO2 actually has a harder time transferring heat by conduction than air at similar temperatures! (Granted these tables don't really take into account the change in air pressure, but it still gives a good enough picture). Likewise, when you look at materials that are effective at transfering heat like concrete, we find a wooping value of  384.1W/m K for temperature around 25C!",Positive,Undefined

For local changes, you can be clever by training for the future in a specific region based on historical measurements for a different, historically warmer region. This works fine for much of the Earth for small changes, but [doesn't work e.g. in the tropics where there is no warmer historical analog](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001351).

**Abstract**

The benefits of the 1987 Montreal Protocol in reducing chlorofluorocarbon emissions, repairing the stratospheric ozone hole, shielding incoming UV radiation, reducing the incidence of skin cancer and mitigating negative ecosystem effects are all well documented. Projected future climate impacts have also been described, mainly focused on a reduced impact of the mid-latitude jet as the ozone hole gradually repairs. However, there is little appreciation of the surface warming that has been avoided as a result of the Montreal Protocol, despite CFCs being potent greenhouse gases. Instead, the issue of ozone depletion and climate change are often thought of as two distinct problems, even though both ozone and CFCs impact Earth's radiation budget. Here we show that a substantial amount of warming has been avoided because of the Montreal Protocol, even after factoring in the surface cooling associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. As of today, as much as 1.1 °C warming has been avoided over parts of the Arctic. Future climate benefits are even stronger, with 3 °C–4 °C Arctic warming and ~1 °C global average warming avoided by 2050; corresponding to a ~25% mitigation of global warming. The Montreal Protocol has thus not only been a major success in repairing the stratospheric ozone hole, it has also achieved substantial mitigation of anthropogenic climate change both today and into the future.",Positive,Global stance

Equilibrium climate sensitivity is between 2 and 4.5, and equilibrium isn't reached for hundreds of years. Currently CO2ppm is going up about 2.11 per year, some years a little more, some a little less, with the rate of CO2 acceleration declining (eventually, it will peak). We are at 410 CO2 ppm. A doubling would be around 550 Ppm. We are, at current rates, barely on track to get there this century, with a peak in emissions likely within the first half of this century (judging by rates of decline in countries that have already peaked, a global peak would be followed by declines of at least 1 percent per year, hell, the USA has no regulations and awful climate policies, and we are on track for a 1.7 percent emissions decline this year.).

There are several tipping points. They are irreversible events that have significant impacts on the climate. They are ""triggered"" at different amounts of warming and some may have already been triggered. However, there is not one tipping point, instead a whole host of them that behave very differently.

You have probably already read this paper but it explains this brilliantly. Figure 3 is useful.

https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252/tab-figures-data

If you would like any more information, feel free to ask.

Edit: This explanation was not the best. They do not happen within a few minutes or days. They can take 100 years to take place and due to the gradual behaviour, it can even be difficult to know if they have been triggered. Some tipping points, such as the Amazon forest dieback have regularly specific causation parameters. But others do not, as Shakhova says ""50Gt of methane is highly possible for abrupt release at any time"". As we do not know when these tipping points will be triggered, hoping that they do not occur is incredibly naïve.",Positive,Undefined

&gt; The Heartland Institute has received at least $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998 but no longer discloses its funding sources. The Union of Concerned Scientists found (PDF) that “Nearly 40% of the total funds that the Heartland Institute has received from ExxonMobil since 1998 were specifically designated for climate change projects.”

You'll find many ""think tanks"" (propaganda groups really) that are dedicated to misleading the public about climate change. They spread many stories, which are not even consistent with each other.

The Heartland Institute also used to work for tobacco companies, to spread the idea that scientists were not really sure about the connection between smoking and lung cancer.

Climate science connects a lot of things, and scientists love to cross validate data and ideas. For temperatures, they use several series of ground measurements, satellite measurements, and ocean temperatures as well (the oceans have stored most of the energy from the additional greenhouse effect). They can also observe in real time the spectrum of light that is emitted by the surface of the Earth and captured by the atmosphere, directly proving and quantifying the greenhouse effect. We also see the consequences of increased temperatures, like glaciers melting, increased moisture in the air and heavier rains (on average), stronger winds, species moving to new habitats and changes in ocean currents. Every discipline keeps the others in check, and there is zero doubt about the general ideas of climate change.

__________

**Abstract**

Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are associated with the largest climate perturbations in Earth’s history. The North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) and Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) constitute an exemplar of this association. As yet we have no means to reconstruct the pacing of LIP greenhouse gas emissions for comparison with climate records at millennial resolution. Here, we calculate carbon-based greenhouse gas fluxes associated with the NAIP at sub-millennial resolution by linking measurements of the mantle convection process that generated NAIP magma with observations of the individual geological structures that controlled gas emissions in a Monte Carlo framework. These simulations predict peak emissions flux of 0.2–0.5 PgC yr^(–1) and show that the NAIP could have initiated PETM climate change. This is the first predictive model of carbon emissions flux from any proposed PETM carbon source that is directly constrained by observations of the geological structures that controlled the emissions.

**Plain Language Summary**

Climate models provide an important way to understand future changes in the Earth's climate. In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Specifically, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics, and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO2 and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2 (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts, and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.


**Abstract**

Retrospectively comparing future model projections to observations provides a robust and independent test of model skill. Here we analyse the performance of climate models published between 1970 and 2007 in projecting future global mean surface temperature (GMST) changes. Models are compared to observations based on both the change in GMST over time and the change in GMST over the change in external forcing. The latter approach accounts for mismatches in model forcings, a potential source of error in model projections independent of the accuracy of model physics. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model‐projected and observationally‐estimated forcings were taken into account.

**Abstract**

Cryptocurrency mining uses significant amounts of energy as part of the proof-of-work time-stamping scheme to add new blocks to the chain. Expanding upon previously calculated energy use patterns for mining four prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero), we estimate the per coin economic damages of air pollution emissions and associated human mortality and climate impacts of mining these cryptocurrencies in the US and China. Results indicate that in 2018, each $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the US and $0.37 in China. The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” roughly match each $1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of policy implications.",Positive,Global stance

_____

**Significance**

The benefit of climate change for forests is that higher atmospheric CO2 allows trees to use less water and photosynthesize more. The problem of climate change is that warmer temperatures make trees use more water and photosynthesize less. We predicted the outcome of these opposing influences using a physiologically realistic model which accounted for the potential adjustment in forest leaf area and related traits to future conditions. If forests fail to adjust, only 55% of climate projections predict a CO2 increase large enough to prevent warming from causing significant drought and mortality. If forests can adjust, the percentage of favorable outcomes rises to 71%. However, uncertainty remains in whether trees can adjust rapidly and in the scatter among climate projections.

**Abstract**

The response of forests to climate change depends in part on whether the photosynthetic benefit from increased atmospheric CO2 (∆Ca = future minus historic CO2) compensates for increased physiological stresses from higher temperature (∆T). We predicted the outcome of these competing responses by using optimization theory and a mechanistic model of tree water transport and photosynthesis. We simulated current and future productivity, stress, and mortality in mature monospecific stands with soil, species, and climate sampled from 20 continental US locations. We modeled stands with and without acclimation to ∆Ca and ∆T, where acclimated forests adjusted leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and stand density to maximize productivity while avoiding stress. Without acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in net primary productivity (NPP) was compromised by ∆T-driven stress and mortality associated with vascular failure. With acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in NPP and stand biomass (C storage) was accentuated for cooler futures but negated for warmer futures by a ∆T-driven reduction in NPP and biomass. Thus, hotter futures reduced forest biomass through either mortality or acclimation. Forest outcomes depended on whether projected climatic ∆Ca/∆T ratios were above or below physiological thresholds that neutralized the negative impacts of warming. Critically, if forests do not acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must be above ca. 89 ppm⋅°C^(−1) to avoid chronic stress, a threshold met by 55% of climate projections. If forests do acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must rise above ca. 67 ppm⋅°C^(−1) for NPP and biomass to increase, a lower threshold met by 71% of projections.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

Am I correct in thinking that the primary greenhouse warming mechanism is:

- the molecule becomes more energetic and transfers it's energy to surrounding molecules via collisions 

And the secondary mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- after some time that molecule may emit an infrared photon as a result.  
- if the direction of emission is downwards then the photon will either strike another CO2 molecule, or strike the earth's surface, warming it.

Shakhova et al 2008 discusses the possibility of a 50Gt release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS).

She only found that 50Gt of the methane hydrates were ""unstable and highly possible for abrupt release at any time"". So while the rest exist, they are not unstable (as of  2008).

There is also an issue of depth, in shallow conditions (approximately 20m below the water) the methane is not oxidised and is (essentially) fully released into the atmosphere. At very low altitudes, the methane is oxidised, by a host of different processes. Therefore, very little is released into the atmosphere.

Therefore, the shallow and unstable hydrates are the ones that lose the biggest threat.

No, it says plankton productivity is declining as a result of current changes.  ""Low"" is a relative term.

It would act as yet another in a long list of feedbacks that both result from anthropogenic warming and also increase the forcing emsemble acting in concert with our emissions.

That decline, in fact, is attributed to:

&gt; a massive accumulation of freshwater (around 15,000 km3 from 1965 to 1990) into the subarctic Atlantic basin follow-ing the great salinity anomaly28 of the late 1960s

They continue:

&gt; According to the relationships that we found, the decrease in upper-ocean densities associated with this event, which has been hypothesized to have weakened deep-water formation across the Labrador and Irminger Seas6,28, may also have led to a diminishing of northern Atlantic planktonic stocks, presumably either through long-term shoaling of the wintertime depth of the mixed layer and the gradual diminishing of euphotic nutrient concentrations1,5,9, or through first-order thermal influences Furthermore, the onset of industrial-era declines in Arctic sea ice and elevated GrIS runoff, which started several decades after our productivity decline and are currently accelerating15,16, suggests that a long-term influx of fresh water into (that is, a freshening of ) northeastern subarctic Atlantic surface waters—similarly implicated in driving the industrial-era AMOC decline1,6–8—may have contributed in sustaining the industrial-era productivity decline over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

From [other sources](https://www.us-ocb.org/industrial-era-climate-forcing-drives-multi-century-decline-na-productivity/):

&gt; the early 19th century onset of declining productivity coincides with the regional onset of industrial-era surface warming, and also strongly covaries with regional sea surface temperatures and basin-scale gyre circulation strength

So no, that source does not support your assertion that ""CO2 is higher now than over the past 800,000 years...[as] a result of reduced phytoplankton productivity which has been linked to the weakened AMO"".  In fact, Industrial Era warming has brought with it a freshwater pulse which is disrupting large scale Atlantic currents which are inhibiting plankton productivity by limiting nutrient fluxes into the deep ocean, so the causality is exactly reversed.

(https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252)

In general, a thorough understanding of the magnitude and urgency of the anthropogenic climate emergency is an essential prerequisite for understanding the necessity of a #GreatTransition and its policy instruments. At the level of science and thought leadership, a robust consensus within the field of climate science has been firmly established thanks to the support of the IPCC. However, Naomi Oreskes and Michael Oppenheimer recently found that the pace of climate change may have been consistently underestimated in the past, due to the desire to converge on the least controversial and most conservative positions. This makes it possible to overlook the fat-tail risks of climate change: low-probability high-impact possibilities within a probability distribution that are more significant than they would be in a normal distribution. In this context, the economist Martin Weitzman defines the climate crisis by its “structural uncertainty about [its] potentially open-ended catastrophic reach”. Xu and Ramanathan rightly point out that while a 1:20 probability estimate, for example, may seem relatively small, most people wouldn’t want to board a plane with a 5% risk of coming down, nor would they want to send their children and grandchildren on that plane. An example for a worst-case scenario based on fat-tail risks has been analyzed by David Spratt and Ian Dunlop. Assuming a mean global temperature increase of 3 degrees C already by 2050, it is anticipated that 35 percent of the global land area, and 55 percent of the global population could be subject to more than 20 days a year of heat conditions lethal to the human body. In conclusion, Oreskes and Oppenheimer recommend that climate scientists experiment with alternative models for making and expressing group judgments, and learn more about how policy makers actually interpret the findings that result.  


With regard to the field of economics, a joint study by climate scientists from LSE, PIK and Columbia University has found out that past economic risk assessments “have been omitting or grossly underestimating many of the most serious consequences for lives and livelihoods”, including the potential for mass migration, displacement and conflict. And it is not only that that the practice of exponential discounting has contributed to a grave delay of climate action in favor of short-term economic growth in the past. In his Nobel Memorial Prize presentation in 2018, the economist William Nordhaus, a major and certainly well-meaning contributor to the IPCC’s Working Group III, is reported to have described a stabilization at a mean global temperature increase of 4 degrees C by 2140 as “optimal” from on an economic cost-benefit perspective. However, considering the dramatic ecological and social consequences of such a temperature increase, it should be apparent that the assumption of continuous economic progress until the end of this century is incompatible with the current business-as-usual carbon emissions trajectory. But according to an analysis by the economist Steve Keen, it appears that the damage function applied by Working Group III failed to consider the possibility of tipping points and ecological and societal discontinuities. The resulting economic damage estimate of a 3.6% global GDP fall for a 4 degree C global warming scenario severely underrepresents the actual social and economic costs to be anticipated. In consequence, the past conclusions of WG III of the IPCC must be revised. Political leaders and policy makers need to be informed. Going forward, a more interdisciplinary, ecologically and ethically informed economic practice, where the risk of societal and economic discontinuities are taken into consideration, is urgently needed.

"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity?

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

**Abstract**

Electricity generation is a large contributor to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. However, the demographic distribution of the resulting exposure is largely unknown. We estimate exposures to and health impacts of PM2.5 from electricity generation in the US, for each of the seven Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), for each US state, by income and by race. We find that average exposures are the highest for blacks, followed by non-Latino whites. Exposures for remaining groups (e.g., Asians, Native Americans, Latinos) are somewhat lower. Disparities by race/ethnicity are observed for each income category, indicating that the racial/ethnic differences hold even after accounting for differences in income. Levels of disparity differ by state and RTO. Exposures are higher for lower-income than for higher-income, but disparities are larger by race than by income. Geographically, we observe large differences between where electricity is generated and where people experience the resulting PM2.5 health consequences; some states are net exporters of health impacts, other are net importers. For 36 US states, most of the health impacts are attributable to emissions in other states. Most of the total impacts are attributable to coal rather than other fuels.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important long-lived GHG and an important stratospheric ozone depleting substance. Agricultural practices and the use of N-fertilizers have greatly enhanced emissions of N2O. Here, we present estimates of N2O emissions determined from three global atmospheric inversion frameworks during the period 1998–2016. We find that global N2O emissions increased substantially from 2009 and at a faster rate than estimated by the IPCC emission factor approach. The regions of East Asia and South America made the largest contributions to the global increase. From the inversion-based emissions, we estimate a global emission factor of 2.3 ± 0.6%, which is significantly larger than the IPCC Tier-1 default for combined direct and indirect emissions of 1.375%. The larger emission factor and accelerating emission increase found from the inversions suggest that N2O emission may have a nonlinear response at global and regional scales with high levels of N-input.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Understanding the response of atmospheric blocking events to climate change has been of great interest in recent years. However, potential changes in the blocking area (size), which can affect the spatio‐temporal characteristics of the resulting extreme events, have not received much attention. Using two large‐ensemble, fully‐coupled GCM simulations, we show that the size of blocking events increases with climate change, particularly in the northern hemisphere (by as much as $17\%$). Using a two‐layer quasi‐geostrophic model and a dimensional analysis technique, we derive a scaling law for the size of blocking events, which shows that area mostly scales with width of the jet times the Kuo scale (i.e., the length of stationary Rossby waves). The scaling law is validated in a range of idealized GCM simulations. Predictions of this scaling law agree well with changes in blocking events' size under climate change in fully‐coupled GCMs in winters but not in summers.",Positive,Global stance

The climate change countermovement (CCCM) in the United States has exerted an important influence on delaying efforts to address climate change.

Expanding this research, this article initiates an examination of the structure of key political coalitions that worked to oppose climate action. In conjunction with their allied trade associations, these coalitions have served as a central coordination mechanism in efforts opposed to mandatory limits on carbon emissions. These coalitions pool resources from a large number of corporations and execute sophisticated political and cultural campaigns designed to oppose efforts to address climate change. Through an analysis of twelve prominent CCCM coalitions from 1989 to 2015, I show that over 2,000 organizations were members of these coalitions and that a core of 179 organizations belonged to multiple coalitions. Organizations from the coal and electrical utility sectors were the most numerous and influential organizations in these coalitions.

____

**Abstract**

Methane has been rising rapidly in the atmosphere over the past decade, contributing to global climate change. Unlike the late 20th century when the rise in atmospheric methane was accompanied by an enrichment in the heavier carbon stable isotope (^(13)C) of methane, methane in recent years has become more depleted in ^(13)C. This depletion has been widely interpreted as indicating a primarily biogenic source for the increased methane. Here we show that part of the change may instead be associated with emissions from shale-gas and shale-oil development. Previous studies have not explicitly considered shale gas, even though most of the increase in natural gas production globally over the past decade is from shale gas. The methane in shale gas is somewhat depleted in ^(13)C relative to conventional natural gas. Correcting earlier analyses for this difference, we conclude that shale-gas production in North America over the past decade may have contributed more than half of all of the increased emissions from fossil fuels globally and approximately one-third of the total increased emissions from all sources globally over the past decade.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

_____

**Abstract**

As the global food system contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, understanding the sources of GHG emissions embodied in different components of food systems is important. The collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a massive restructuring of the domestic food systems, namely declining consumption of animal products, cropland abandonment, and a major restructuring of agricultural trade. However, how these complex changes have affected global GHG emissions is uncertain. Here, we quantified the net GHG emissions associated with changes in the former Soviet Union's food systems. Changes in food production, consumption, and trade together resulted in a net emissions reduction of 7.61 Gt carbon dioxide equivalents from 1992 to 2011. For comparison, this corresponds to one quarter of the CO2 emissions from deforestation in Latin America from 1991 to 2011. The key drivers of the emissions reductions were the decreasing beef consumption in the 1990s, increasing beef imports after 2000, mainly from South America, and carbon sequestration in soils on abandoned cropland. Ongoing transformations of the food systems in the former Soviet Union, however, suggest emissions will likely rebound. The results highlight the importance of considering agricultural production, land-use change, trade, and consumption when assessing countries emissions portfolios. Moreover, we demonstrated how emissions reductions that originate from a reduction in the extent and intensity of agricultural production can be compromised by increasing emissions embodied in rising imports of agricultural commodities.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

___

**Abstract**

Permafrost is thawing extensively due to climate warming. When permafrost thaws, previously frozen organic carbon (OC) is converted into carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane, leading to further warming. This process is included in models as gradual deepening of the seasonal non‐frozen layer. Yet, models neglect abrupt OC mobilization along rapidly eroding Arctic coastlines. We mimicked erosion in an experiment by incubating permafrost with seawater for an average Arctic open‐water season. We found that CO2 production from permafrost OC is as efficient in seawater as without. For each gram (dry weight) of eroding permafrost, up to 4.3 ± 1.0 mg CO2 will be released and 6.2 ± 1.2% of initial OC mineralized at 4 °C. Our results indicate that potentially large amounts of CO2 are produced along eroding permafrost coastlines, onshore and within nearshore waters. We conclude that coastal erosion could play an important role in carbon cycling and the climate system.

**Plain Language Summary**

The permanently frozen soils of the Arctic, known as permafrost, store large amounts of organic carbon, which accumulated over millennia due to slow decomposition in the cold Arctic regions. With climate warming this frozen organic carbon reservoir thaws and microbes recycle it quickly into greenhouse gases, which in turn support further warming. A slow and continuous thaw is currently used in models to project future greenhouse gas release from permafrost. Yet along the rapidly eroding coastlines of the Arctic Ocean, which make up 34% of the Earth's coastlines, whole stretches of the coast simply collapse, sink or slide into the ocean, including the previously frozen organic carbon. We simulated greenhouse gas release in response to coastline collapse in a laboratory experiment by simply mixing permafrost with seawater. We show that large amounts of carbon dioxide are being produced during the Arctic open‐water season. Our study indicates that eroding permafrost coasts in the Arctic are potentially a major source of carbon dioxide. With increasing loss of sea ice, longer open‐water seasons, and exposure of coasts to waves, we highlight the importance of coastal erosion for potential carbon dioxide emissions.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is targeted for emissions mitigation by the US state of California and other jurisdictions worldwide. Unique opportunities for mitigation are presented by point-source emitters—surface features or infrastructure components that are typically less than 10 metres in diameter and emit plumes of highly concentrated methane. However, data on point-source emissions are sparse and typically lack sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to guide their mitigation and to accurately assess their magnitude. Here we survey more than 272,000 infrastructure elements in California using an airborne imaging spectrometer that can rapidly map methane plumes. We conduct five campaigns over several months from 2016 to 2018, spanning the oil and gas, manure-management and waste-management sectors, resulting in the detection, geolocation and quantification of emissions from 564 strong methane point sources. Our remote sensing approach enables the rapid and repeated assessment of large areas at high spatial resolution for a poorly characterized population of methane emitters that often appear intermittently and stochastically. We estimate net methane point-source emissions in California to be 0.618 teragrams per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.523–0.725), equivalent to 34–46 per cent of the state’s methane inventory for 2016. Methane ‘super-emitter’ activity occurs in every sector surveyed, with 10 per cent of point sources contributing roughly 60 per cent of point-source emissions—consistent with a study of the US Four Corners region that had a different sectoral mix. The largest methane emitters in California are a subset of landfills, which exhibit persistent anomalous activity. Methane point-source emissions in California are dominated by landfills (41 per cent), followed by dairies (26 per cent) and the oil and gas sector (26 per cent). Our data have enabled the identification of the 0.2 per cent of California’s infrastructure that is responsible for these emissions. Sharing these data with collaborating infrastructure operators has led to the mitigation of anomalous methane-emission activity.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

Valid questions! First of all, I have to disagree with your assertion that most people’s opinions on climate change are politically based. Anecdotally- all people I know who are activists against human caused climate change are activists because of their scientific beliefs. 

Your questions have to do with the global carbon cycle (which I have attached a link to below). Essentially what is happening is that human emissions are offsetting the global near-balance of carbon between the ocean, land and air. Though human emissions are small in comparison to the natural sinks and emissions of the world they are enough to disrupt the cycle. We emit approximately 29 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Much is then taken into the oceans etc, but lots remains in the atmosphere adding to the greenhouse effect.

I'm going ""yes it is"" on this.

There's several groups keeping track of the temperature, some using completely different data. (Satellites instead of temperature stations). 

[http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1970/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1970/plot/rss](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1970/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1970/plot/rss)

\&gt;Temperatures have been high in the past (when dinosaurs were about). 

Yeah. In some ways it's the same temperature. In that we're digging up the carbon that was in the atmosphere in the long past and putting it back.

And that would not be problematic if we were interested in the survival of mesosuars and stegosaurs. But, alas, they're already extinct. We're looking to keep current ecosystems alive and current infrastructure. And for the past couple or few million years the CO2 has alternated between 190 and 290ppm. It's departure from that that nothing alive today has had to live with.

\&gt; even if it was, 2 degrees doesn't seem much, and I don't see how it will affect me.

It depends where you live. Is he near the ocean? In a wheat or maise growing area? Near a desert? A flood plane?

It will affect ecosystems. For the example of eucalyptus in Australia, 41% of species have a range covering less than 2°C . That means they are comitted to extinction for a 2°C rise, unless they migrate outside their current range. Trees don't migrate quickly, and you have to go upwards or polewards, and eventually you run out of space.

So the disruption to ecosystems is more than you might think.

2) It's 2 degrees C, globally averaged, for the whole year. When your Christmas is 15 F warmer than usual and white xmas becomes an urban legend it's going to be noticeable.

The temperature has risen 1.0 C so far and we are locked in for 1.5 C and racing towards &gt; 2 C. An important point about this is the concept of thermal interia - think about when you apply heat to a pot of water, the water doesn't quickly reach the temperature, but if you apply heat to a solid object it heats up quicker.  This is because of the high heat capacity of water and once that water heats up it releases water vapour (another powerful greenhouse gas) and takes along time to cool down.  This is what's happening to the oceans, they will continue to heat up for decades even if we stopped emitting GHG tomorrow. 
* A big issue with the temperature rise is how quickly it's occurring.  Yes if the temperature slowly over thousands or even just hundreds of years changed life would adapt and we'd probably be fine.  But the rate of change is over just a few short decades, even humans will struggle to adapt. 
* It's important to understand 2 C rise doesn't mean that a 23 C day becomes a 25 C day and that the rise is uniform across the globe.  There are actually some areas that will become colder and in the tropics they are already witness &gt; 2 C and will likely see 6 C temp rise which is fucking huge and deadly.  You can't drive this point in hard enough. It's not a uniform change.  The way your friend is likely thinking about it is how as a process engineer thinks of a process shift, which is to say the temperature just shifts up 2 C and that is not what is happening.  The **extremes** push the average up which is an increase in instability.  And it's those extremes that cause the air to hold more water and dump massive down pours and then suddenly shift to suck up all that moisture again.  This is how we are witnessing micro droughts in the southern United States and this sort of phenomena will increase and it *is* and *will continue* to affect crop production.
* He's wrong, there have been many deadly events.  The problem is, if we are honest it's hard to say a particular weather event like the heat wave in Moscow that killed 55,000 people or the heat wave in Europe  that killed 70,000 or Sandy or Katrina etc... is directly related to global climate change.  We can say that the trend of these extreme events is due to climate change and that climate change increases the wind speed and energy dissipation of hurricanes etc... 
* The fact that the changes are year over year now should scare the fuck out of anyone being honest with themselves.  I don't know how old your friend is, but I'm old enough to have witnessed the shift.  It's here and it's getting worse every year.

My experience with climate change deniers is they have a history of convenient updates to their beliefs. Not long ago, your friend probably denied that the world was warming, insisting that scientists had some sort of vague profit motive to produce false data, etc. Now that even Fox News sometimes admits that we are getting hotter, the tune changes. 

I gently ask if the fact that they have had to update their opinion several times over the past few years might mean that this is an evolving body of knowledge and perhaps they should be a bit more open to the idea that it’s time to make yet another adjustment. 

The idea that koolaid believers are not worth the time spent in discussion is not always correct. However, the approach of “This is why you are wrong” is rarely successful. Try an attitude that is gentler by not backing them into a corner that they will feel obligated to defend to the death.

Yes there have been cycles in the past but this dinosaurs didn't CAUSE those cycles. We are. Specifically what makes us different from the dinosaurs is that the dinosaurs didn't have an industrial revolution. Our industrial revolution and subsequent rise in co2 and other chemical pollution coincides with the global increase in temperature.

It could be a coincidence - but given the scientific backing - we should go ahead and improve the planet anyway.

2) Plants and their yields are very susceptible to environment. 2 more degrees on average (btw the prediction is closer to 4 now) means in the hot times and in the cold. This effects everything from crop yields to polinating insects to disease. 2 degrees will likely cause food shortages, and hence climate refugees. This may lead to food riots and a police state.

"This video is currently circulating through part of my family:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno)

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

____

**Significance**

Sea-level rise poses a threat to coastal areas and will continue for centuries, even after global mean temperature has stabilized. Research assessing the implications of current international climate mitigation efforts usually focuses on 21st century climate impacts. The multicentennial sea-level rise commitment of pledged near-term emission reduction efforts under the Paris Agreement has not been quantified yet. We here estimate this sea-level rise commitment and find that pledged emissions until 2030 lock in 1-m sea-level rise in the year 2300. Our analysis highlights the defining role of present-day emissions for future sea-level rise and points to the potential of reducing the long-term sea-level-rise commitment by more ambitious national emission reduction targets.

**Abstract**

The main contributors to sea-level rise (oceans, glaciers, and ice sheets) respond to climate change on timescales ranging from decades to millennia. A focus on the 21st century thus fails to provide a complete picture of the consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on future sea-level rise and its long-term impacts. Here we identify the committed global mean sea-level rise until 2300 from historical emissions since 1750 and the currently pledged National Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement until 2030. Our results indicate that greenhouse gas emissions over this 280-y period result in about 1 m of committed global mean sea-level rise by 2300, with the NDC emissions from 2016 to 2030 corresponding to around 20 cm or 1/5 of that commitment. We also find that 26 cm (12 cm) of the projected sea-level-rise commitment in 2300 can be attributed to emissions from the top 5 emitting countries (China, United States of America, European Union, India, and Russia) over the 1991–2030 (2016–2030) period. Our findings demonstrate that global and individual country emissions over the first decades of the 21st century alone will cause substantial long-term sea-level rise.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

I started reading about climate change a couple years ago and my initial reaction was one of hopelessness and immense fear of the future. “How could we have let things get so bad? What can we do to fix it? What will this mean for my life and life of my family?”. These were all questions that I had bouncing around in my head.

I began looking into the issue, but unfortunately it is such a polarized  one that it can be hard to find and analyze information if you don’t have a science background (which I don’t) and are unfamiliar with a lot of the terminology and methods. I have since tried to stick to what the science was saying and, while I still worry about what this will mean for our future, I am not feeling panicked like I was when I first started learning about climate change. It’s bad. But there is still plenty we can do to make it better. I also have noticed a lot more attention on the issue recently and think that public support for fighting climate change is only going to grow faster and faster. Seeing young people like Greta Thunburg bring attention to this has also made me very hopeful. People are starting to realize that we can’t drag our feet on this anymore than we have, and I’m hopeful that we’ll see even more activists like her drawing attention to it.

Like I said I’m not a scientist and there has already been some great responses here, so I’ll just say that the best way to reduce your anxiety on this issue is to, oddly enough, inform yourself more about it and the actions that you can take individually. I found that once I knew more about what we are up against and what the actual science is saying, it wasn’t  as scary as when I felt overwhelmed by it all. Also be careful when it comes to articles about climate change. The headlines can often be misleading, either downplaying the issue or exaggerating it depending on the audience. Even on subreddits like r/worldnews I’ve notice that people rarely read the actual content of articles that are posted, only reading the title and drawing a conclusion from it alone. Don’t fall into that trap, and also try to read the actual studies and other sources from scientific journals. Those are the best source for info but can be a bit dry to read, or confusing for a layman. Hope I helped in some way, and just know that things are getting better, it’s just gonna take a while.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Atomic-level understanding of the active sites and transformation mechanisms under realistic working conditions is a prerequisite for rational design of high-performance photocatalysts. Here, by using correlated scanning fluorescence X-ray microscopy and environmental transmission electron microscopy at atmospheric pressure, in operando, we directly observe that the (110) facet of a single Cu2O photocatalyst particle is photocatalytically active for CO2 reduction to methanol while the (100) facet is inert. The oxidation state of the active sites changes from Cu(i) towards Cu(ii) due to CO2 and H2O co-adsorption and changes back to Cu(i) after CO2 conversion under visible light illumination. The Cu2O photocatalyst oxidizes water as it reduces CO2. Concomitantly, the crystal lattice expands due to CO2 adsorption then reverts after CO2 conversion. The internal quantum yield for unassisted wireless photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol using Cu2O crystals is ~72%.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Identifying processes within the Earth System that have modulated atmospheric pCO₂ during each glacial cycle of the late Pleistocene stands as one of the grand challenges in climate science. The growing array of surface ocean pH estimates from the boron isotope proxy across the last glacial termination may reveal regions of the ocean that influenced the timing and magnitude of pCO₂ rise. Here we present two new boron isotope records from the subtropical‐subpolar transition zone of the Southwest Pacific that span the last 20 kyr, as well as new radiocarbon data from the same cores. The new data suggest this region was a source of carbon to the atmosphere rather than a moderate sink as it is today. Significantly higher outgassing is observed between ~16.5 and 14 kyr BP, associated with increasing δ^(13)C and [CO₃]^(2−) at depth, suggesting loss of carbon from the intermediate ocean to the atmosphere. We use these new boron isotope records together with existing records to build a composite pH/pCO₂ curve for the surface oceans. The pH disequilibrium/CO₂ outgassing was widespread throughout the last deglaciation, likely explained by upwelling of CO₂ from the deep/intermediate ocean. During the Holocene, a smaller outgassing peak is observed at a time of relatively stable atmospheric CO₂, which may be explained by regrowth of the terrestrial biosphere countering ocean CO₂ release. Our stack is likely biased toward upwelling/CO₂ source regions. Nevertheless, the composite pCO₂ curve provides robust evidence that various parts of the ocean were releasing CO₂ to the atmosphere over the last 25 kyr.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Projections of global rice yields account for climate change. They do not, however, consider the coupled stresses of impending climate change and arsenic in paddy soils. Here, we show in a greenhouse study that future conditions cause a greater proportion of pore-water arsenite, the more toxic form of arsenic, in the rhizosphere of Californian Oryza sativa L. variety M206, grown on Californian paddy soil. As a result, grain yields decrease by 39% compared to yields at today’s arsenic soil concentrations. In addition, future climatic conditions cause a nearly twofold increase of grain inorganic arsenic concentrations. Our findings indicate that climate-induced changes in soil arsenic behaviour and plant response will lead to currently unforeseen losses in rice grain productivity and quality. Pursuing rice varieties and crop management practices that alleviate the coupled stresses of soil arsenic and change in climatic factors are needed to overcome the currently impending food crisis.",Positive,Global stance

Each of the above links is provided with commentary from climate researchers of some form or another.

The foundation of the denial of climate science is not a position undertaken by individuals with logically sound arguments and reason. It is either a failure of critical thinking (valid arguments but not sound, or simply invalid arguments) or rooted in ideological conditions that predispose one to reject factual statements over one's own personal belief system. If it's an issue with critical thinking, it could likely be corrected for by showing different types of fallacious arguments and which one they are potentially invoking to support their arguments^[1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799) . On the other hand, and I could very well be wrong, I believe that dogmatic personal belief systems cannot be changed by the showing facts - rather this may entrench them further in regard to their personal belief. For example, note the Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate when Ken Ham is asked ""What if anything would ever change your mind?"" and he replies that the bible is the word of God and that ""as far as the word of God is concerned, no one's ever going to convince me that the word of God is not true.""",Positive,Undefined

Totally unreasonable for them to live a low fossil fuel life. Generally anywhere rural its challenging to ditch your car.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno)

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics.

While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory.

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

Edit: grammar and added link to 'clathrate gun' theory showing recent spikes in methane.",2019,10,Complete newbie looking to learn more - Really appreciate any insights.,"&gt;&gt; Are we locked in for 2 - 3 oC regardless? It seems odd that IPCC wold put forth a plan that they know is going to fail (e.g. their proposed carbon budget in order to stay below 2oC)

A key note about carbon budgets is they output a probability distribution of warming under various models. It's not like a shopping budget where you pick your items off the shelf and they ring you up and you get what you paid for. What you pay for with a carbon budget is a *chance* of limiting heating to a given level. The carbon budget you reference from the SR1.5 report is for a 66% chance of limiting heating to 1.5C I believe. That is, it has a roughly 1/3 chance of failing to limit heating to that range. If this seems an obscenely low chance of probability of success to accept for such an important target, that's because it is. It's chosen essentially because safer probabilities imply carbon budgets that are essentially impossibly small- ie, this is a matter of public relations rather than a tangible goal. It is a way of denying/minimizing exactly how badly the global leadership and dominant economic system has already failed on the climate crisis. Prof. Michael Mann recently criticized the assumptions underlying the SR 1.5 budgetary analysis as being too conservative with regards to expected heating.

Based on IPCC AR5, it's possible that 2C is already geophysically locked in, a good estimate is that this is the case with about 25% percent probability. That is, the carbon budget for a 75% chance of limiting heating to 2C is already zero. For greater probabilities the budget is negative. See David Spratt [""The real budgetary emergency and the myth of burnable carbon""](https://www.climatecodered.org/2014/05/the-real-budgetary-emergency-burnable.html)



[This talk by Prof. Kevin Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZFvc-ZOa8&amp;t=38s), who has experience with carbon budget analysis, disambiguates some of the issues around the contradiction between the hard reality of real mitigation for 2C and the policy recommendations of the IPCC Workging Group III(which are made by economists and political scientists without vetting from climate scientists). IPCC WG III is constitutionally incapable of recommending the radical policy shifts that real mitigation entails because such policy conflicts directly with the dominant neoliberal economic growth centered agenda, and their promulgation of speculative negative emissions technologies to be deployed over the coming century to suck hundreds of gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere can be viewed as an attempt to mythologize the abject failure of neoliberalism versus the climate crisis. By conjuring up hundreds of gigatons of negative emissions, they generate fictitious policy framework carbon budgets that are roughly double the budgets that derive from physical science. This essentially contitutes fixing the facts around the policy (economic growth at all costs) rather than basing the policy in the facts (extremely fast real mitigation is needed to hold 2C, at a rate inconsistent with market based policy and economic growth.)

Essentially, mitigation in line with 2C constitutes a radical global socioeconomic transformation beyond anything the world is currently countenancing and given the history of inertia over the last decades it seems very unlikely that the world will be capable of pulling it off. See here for a [condensed 6 minute presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDCQkrRJmA) on this.


Prof. Anderson and Prof. Steve Keen have called out the policy advice of the IPCC. Anderson has accused WGIII of ""technocratic fraud"" and Prof. Keen has called for economists to be ""removed from the IPCC.""

"This video is currently circulating through part of my family:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno)

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

,2019,10,"Antarctic sea ice is key to triggering ice ages, study finds","Study: [Global cooling linked to increased glacial carbon storage via changes in Antarctic sea ice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0466-8)
____

**Abstract**

Palaeo-oceanographic reconstructions indicate that the distribution of global ocean water masses has undergone major glacial–interglacial rearrangements over the past ~2.5 million years. Given that the ocean is the largest carbon reservoir, such circulation changes were probably key in driving the variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations observed in the ice-core record. However, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of the ocean’s role in regulating CO2 on these timescales. Here, we show that glacial ocean–sea ice numerical simulations with a single-basin general circulation model, forced solely by atmospheric cooling, can predict ocean circulation patterns associated with increased atmospheric carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. Under such conditions, Antarctic bottom water becomes more isolated from the sea surface as a result of two connected factors: reduced air–sea gas exchange under sea ice around Antarctica and weaker mixing with North Atlantic Deep Water due to a shallower interface between southern- and northern-sourced water masses. These physical changes alone are sufficient to explain ~40 ppm atmospheric CO2 drawdown—about half of the glacial–interglacial variation. Our results highlight that atmospheric cooling could have directly caused the reorganization of deep ocean water masses and, thus, glacial CO2 drawdown. This provides an important step towards a consistent picture of glacial climates.",Negative,Undefined

5.3C is a figure for ECS from CESM2. The E in ECS means Equilibrium, therefore we will experience this warming when the earth system enters equilibrium. That takes a few hundred years. Therefore 5.3C is a figure for about 2400.

&gt;Yeah i definitely understand why models tend to stop at 2100... no point in going past it as modern society will be long gone...

There are a few reasons, I am currently talking about this with u/aClimateScientist

&gt;Sorry i don't follow the debate. Shouldn't observational data be taken over any model - it seems odd to assume the models are right when someone is presenting actual evidence. Well this is even more concerning. I tried googling it but couldn't find anything that seems reputable. I did find a lot debunking articles ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LifcMZyCYmc) from what appear to be renown scientists. 

It's a bit more nuanced, but yes observations should take priority over models (in some cases not as observational ECS measurements have been a bit weird)

&gt;What is the expected time frame till it goes off - 5 - 10 years? and how rapidly will we feel the effects? I'd think its fairly instant.

For the methane release, Shakhova says ""abrupt release at any time"". So possibly under 5 years. As it would be sudden release of methane (about 50Gt, 50 billion tonnes), this warming would portray itself in about 1-2C warming almost instantaneously. I have been quite approximate because we do not quite know how these hydrates behave.

&gt;this seems to be orders or magnitude greater than what IPCC put out in their Special Report 1.5. I though the plan was that in order to stay below 2oC by 2100 we would need to be carbon neutral by 2050.

&gt;Why isn't the IPCC including this in their reports and summary in bold letters on top of everything?

For a wealth of reasons, the IPCC often don't include some of the more niche areas of climate science. The IPCC does acknowledge that CO2 will be released from the Arctic, it does not include methane release.

Again, I don't feel like typing up an essay about it, but the IPCC tend to be quite conservative, their SLR (Sea Level Rise) and temperature predictions tend to be on the lower side. They also have 4.5C has a top end of their ECS predictions, lower than the newer models.",Positive,Undefined

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.

Meaning that they predict more warming when the earth system is in equilibrium after a doubling of CO2. CESM2 had one of 5.3, and one modelling centre for CIMP6 came up with 7C by 2100. Again, that is extremely high and should be taken with scepticism. However, a higher ECS does tend to be a trend and is extremely worrying, meaning that steeper emissions cuts are needed.

That is downright frightening... but i also don't fully understand it. If i understood this link correctly: [https://news.ucar.edu/132678/ncars-new-climate-model-running-hot](https://news.ucar.edu/132678/ncars-new-climate-model-running-hot), then around \~2040 we will go from 280 ppm Co2 to \~560 ppm and temperatures are expected to be 5.3oC - 7oC - this seems to be orders or magnitude greater than what IPCC put out in their Special Report 1.5. I though the plan was that in order to stay below 2oC by 2100 we would need to be carbon neutral by 2050.

Yeah i definitely understand why models tend to stop at 2100... no point in going past it as modern society will be long gone...

&gt; She has found that some of these hydrates are unstable and could release their methane at any time. However, her observations were quickly whisked away when the models said otherwise. Dr Peter Wadhams has talked about this but it created an interesting precedent, who to trust, observations or models? 

Sorry i don't follow the debate. Shouldn't observational data be taken over any model - it seems odd to assume the models are right when someone is presenting actual evidence. Well this is even more concerning. I tried googling it but couldn't find anything that seems reputable. I did find a lot debunking articles ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LifcMZyCYmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LifcMZyCYmc)) from what appear to be renown scientists. 

Why isn't the IPCC including this in their reports and summary in bold letters on top of everything? I feel like I am missing something here. What is the expected time frame till it goes off - 5 - 10 years? and how rapidly will we feel the effects? I'd think its fairly instant.

&gt; Just quickly looking, 3C is possible, but 1.5C is essentially impossible. I have not read the rest though.

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.

&gt;Fair enough. Why do you think that? Is it because you read something? Just resigned it out?

CO2 and temperature don't correlate in the deeper geological time there are graphs that show this. 

Also sea rise is linear if you look at the graphs at 2 to 3mm a year and temp rise is 0.02 rise in a linear fashon. All the sea rise alarmism is from the 'climate models that show acceleration'. In the real world there is no acceleration.

Finally green house gas is 2% of the atmosphere. 95% is water vapour. 4% is CO2 . Most CO2 is from the plants and ocean and is part of the carbon cycle. Only 3% of the 4% is from man made 8 billion people trying to survive. 

The IPCC only looks at this 3% and does no research on water vapour , cloud seeding etc. 

So. not enough evidence.Also the Ice caps are growing in Antartica and are presently at 2007 levels in the Arctic.

"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

&gt; I want a child

I would advise against it, for the obvious reason that it will probably live beyond 2100. 

Edit: As u/aClimateScientist said, not all models stop at 2100, and some CIMP6 models go to 2300. But if you look at most papers and models, they will stop their predictions at 2100, for reasons such as lowered accuracy.

I would like to clarify my position on this, I am trying to say that we are not fully sure just how things are going to go past 2100, yes some models do go beyond 2100 but lots of climate science stops there. We can have a guess that it will be bad. And just as the IPCC assuming that carbon capture will come into existence soon, assuming that your child's generation will solve it is a bad idea.

Beyond that, models stop, so we have literally no idea what will happen and you are giving that uncertainty to your child.

&gt;I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before

Like u/aClimateScientist said, it is partly because of clouds. Clouds are the wildcards in climate modelling, a relatively small change can massively alter a model and we have not quite pinned down how they will change in the future. But newer models have a higher ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity). Meaning that they predict more warming when the earth system is in equilibrium after a doubling of CO2. CESM2 had one of 5.3, and one modelling centre for CIMP6 came up with 7C by 2100. Again, that is extremely high and should be taken with scepticism. However, a higher ECS does tend to be a trend and is extremely worrying, meaning that steeper emissions cuts are needed.

&gt;*extinction within the next 50 years?*

Calm down McPherson!

&gt;I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory

The clathrate gun is no longer really supported, it is a hypothesis in which methane release causes a chain of methane release. And while there are positive feedbacks in the methane hydrates, the clathrate gun goes beyond that. Natalia Shakhova is an Arctic researcher who has been studying methane hydrates for about 20 years. She has found that some of these hydrates are unstable and could release their methane at any time. However, her observations were quickly whisked away when the models said otherwise. Dr Peter Wadhams has talked about this but it created an interesting precedent, who to trust, observations or models?

Shakhova's results are more aligned with a methane bomb than with the clathrate gun. Igor Semelitov, another Arctic researcher who has worked with Shakhova has joust found very intense plumes of methane in the Arctic Ocean.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? 

The carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released for a certain amount of warming. Again, it varies greatly and climate sensitivity plays a role.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

It does appear to be unlikely, but with the methane release and the other feedbacks, it is important to have a high-end estimate.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it.

Just quickly looking, 3C is possible, but 1.5C is essentially impossible. I have not read the rest though.

___

**Abstract**

Over the past eight hundred thousand years, glacial–interglacial cycles oscillated with a period of one hundred thousand years (‘100k world’). Ice core and ocean sediment data have shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide, Antarctic temperature, deep ocean temperature, and global ice volume correlated strongly with each other in the 100k world. Between about 2.8 and 1.2 million years ago, glacial cycles were smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration (‘40k world’). Proxy data from deep-sea sediments suggest that the variability of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 40k world was also lower than in the 100k world, but we do not have direct observations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from this period. Here we report the recovery of stratigraphically discontinuous ice more than two million years old from the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area, East Antarctica. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in ice core samples older than two million years have been altered by respiration, but some younger samples are pristine. The recovered ice cores extend direct observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and Antarctic temperature (based on the deuterium/hydrogen isotope ratio δD_ice, a proxy for regional temperature) into the 40k world. All climate properties before eight hundred thousand years ago fall within the envelope of observations from continuous deep Antarctic ice cores that characterize the 100k world. However, the lowest measured carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and Antarctic temperature in the 40k world are well above glacial values from the past eight hundred thousand years. Our results confirm that the amplitudes of glacial–interglacial variations in atmospheric greenhouse gases and Antarctic climate were reduced in the 40k world, and that the transition from the 40k to the 100k world was accompanied by a decline in minimum carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial maxima.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Intact tropical forests, free from substantial anthropogenic influence, store and sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon but are currently neglected in international climate policy. We show that between 2000 and 2013, direct clearance of intact tropical forest areas accounted for 3.2% of gross carbon emissions from all deforestation across the pantropics. However, full carbon accounting requires the consideration of forgone carbon sequestration, selective logging, edge effects, and defaunation. When these factors were considered, the net carbon impact resulting from intact tropical forest loss between 2000 and 2013 increased by a factor of 6 (626%), from 0.34 (0.37 to 0.21) to 2.12 (2.85 to 1.00) petagrams of carbon (equivalent to approximately 2 years of global land use change emissions). The climate mitigation value of conserving the 549 million ha of tropical forest that remains intact is therefore significant but will soon dwindle if their rate of loss continues to accelerate.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.

There are four decisions made in plotting these graphs that are problematic: 

* Choice of baseline,
* Inconsistent smoothing,
* Incomplete representation of the initial condition and structural uncertainty in the models,
* No depiction of the structural uncertainty in the satellite observations.

One example in relation to the above graph:

Christy purports to be using 5-yr running mean smoothing, and mostly he does. However at the ends of the observational data sets, he is using a 4 and then 3-yr smoothing for the two end points. This is equivalent to assuming that the subsequent 2 years will be equal to the mean of the previous 3 and in a situation where there is strong trend, that is unlikely to be true.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

Just a follow up. Could you please elaborate on what you mean why the collapse of modern society? Are you referring to a regression to farming/agricultural lives after hundreds of millions perish? Or is the concern that we won't have economic growth and we may have less types of fish in the supermarket? I'm sure the answer lies somewhere in between, but if love to better understand what climate scientists are worried will happen on the next 30-50 years. 

And when you refer to high-emission scenerios are you referring to RCP 4.5, 6.0, or 8.5? If I understand correctly, currently we are tracking RCP 6, right? Is RCP 8.5 feasible?

We are not worried about human extinction. We *are* concerned that collapse of *modern* society, in which we’ve come to expect continuous economic growth and quality of life improvements, is within the realm of possibility in high-emissions scenarios and especially for regions of the world that are most vulnerable (e.g. low-lying poor countries in the tropics).

I agree. Alarmist rhetoric makes me uncomfortable. Take a second to yourself in their shoes - If you’re watching the temperature graphs go up, and they match the CO2 graphs well enough to convince you that’s the problem (their shoes, not yours), and you hear that melting ice may release even more CO2, reflect less light back to space and cause the seas to rise. If weather changes enough that we have to move where we farm to places without years and years of soil buildup (or indoors), etc etc. if even half of that is true, it does fee like the house is on fire and sounding the alarm is the only responsible thing to do.

Specifically answering to this. Hello from Germany!

I thought we were phasing out coal, not building any new. Did a quick research anyways.

https://endcoal.org/tracker/ shows just one shameful unit for Germany under construction. It's [Kraftwerk Datteln](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk_Datteln), where apparently they want to replace an old block-unit with a new one. Construction started in 2007, but a court stopped it in 2009. There was quite a back and forth, until construction continued in 2017.

Most of our coal plants are operating or retired.

According to the tracker, Japan does build quite a number of coal power plants. [In 2019](http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/i/mitigation_curves_1.5C_190423.png).",Positive,Undefined

Since CoastalDEM is defined only where SRTM elevation is lower than or equal to 20 m, such areas are disregarded in this analysis, leading to some underestimation of exposure.

**Abstract**

Most estimates of global mean sea-level rise this century fall below 2 m. This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA’s SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show – employing CoastalDEM—that 190 M people (150–250 M, 90% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 250 M below 1 m.",Positive,Global stance
,2019,10,Going entirely organic could mean food emissions up 70% in England and Wales,"Oh dear, that’s a dreadful take away from this work. Good science(ish) hindered by blinkered thinking I fear.
I’d like to see the conclusion note instead that: only for farming practices analysed these negative values are reached, therefore it is farming practices specifically (and perhaps a return to bio regional demand) that need to change in order to optimise organic farming yields to the greater rates achieved elsewhere, so as to result in both lower emissions along with the plethora of additional benefits we obtain from growing organic food.

From a quick read I think the paper demonstrates commendable analysis but within a very narrow focus of business and practice as usual projected into the future, thus creating bias in favour of non organic farming. Also a lot of poor practice meat farming.

No mention of alternative measures (aside from co2 emissions) to compare practices. What about water use or yields in drought years? Much better for organic.
Nor nutritional content, calorific value etc as models to determine productivity.
I understand this was a fairly necessary limitation in order to conduct such a study, but there are other/better models to employ. Needs mention.
Additionally the huge array of alternative farming practices, types of food grown, changes in diet, advances in harvesting etc etc that will occur over time as we transition (hopes) will all effect results and should be commented on as limitations.

**Abstract**

Agriculture is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and must feature in efforts to reduce emissions. Organic farming might contribute to this through decreased use of farm inputs and increased soil carbon sequestration, but it might also exacerbate emissions through greater food production elsewhere to make up for lower organic yields. To date there has been no rigorous assessment of this potential at national scales. Here we assess the consequences for net GHG emissions of a 100% shift to organic food production in England and Wales using life-cycle assessment. We predict major shortfalls in production of most agricultural products against a conventional baseline. Direct GHG emissions are reduced with organic farming, but when increased overseas land use to compensate for shortfalls in domestic supply are factored in, net emissions are greater. Enhanced soil carbon sequestration could offset only a small part of the higher overseas emissions.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

___

**Significance**

The Bengal Fan is the largest sedimentary deposit in the world and has previously been shown to represent a major sink of carbon that may have contributed to the Cenozoic cooling trend. Wood transport has been observed in rivers during the high flows of the monsoon season, or associated with events such as cyclones, earthquake-triggered landslide and dam-and-release events from the mountains. However, wood was not widely thought to survive export and burial in the oceans. This study shows that woody debris can survive thousands of kilometers of transport in rivers and in turbidites, to be deposited in the fan. Wood has been overlooked in quantification of organic carbon burial on continental margins.

**Abstract**

The Ganges–Brahmaputra (G-B) River system transports over a billion tons of sediment every year from the Himalayan Mountains to the Bay of Bengal and has built the world’s largest active sedimentary deposit, the Bengal Fan. High sedimentation rates drive exceptional organic matter preservation that represents a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2. While much attention has been paid to organic-rich fine sediments, coarse sediments have generally been overlooked as a locus of organic carbon (OC) burial. However, International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 354 recently discovered abundant woody debris (millimeter- to centimeter-sized fragments) preserved within the coarse sediment layers of turbidite beds recovered from 6 marine drill sites along a transect across the Bengal Fan (∼8°N, ∼3,700-m water depth) with recovery spanning 19 My. Analysis of bulk wood and lignin finds mostly lowland origins of wood delivered episodically. In the last 5 My, export included C4 plants, implying that coarse woody, lowland export continued after C4 grassland expansion, albeit in reduced amounts. Substantial export of coarse woody debris in the last 1 My included one wood-rich deposit (∼0.05 Ma) that encompassed coniferous wood transported from the headwaters. In coarse layers, we found on average 0.16 weight % OC, which is half the typical biospheric OC content of sediments exported by the modern G-B Rivers. Wood burial estimates are hampered by poor drilling recovery of sands. However, high-magnitude, low-frequency wood export events are shown to be a key mechanism for C burial in turbidites.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Significance**

Debate lingers over what caused the last mass extinction 66 million years ago, with intense volcanism and extraterrestrial impact the most widely supported hypotheses. However, without empirical evidence for either’s exact environmental effects, it is difficult to discern which was most important in driving extinction. It is also unclear why recovery of biodiversity and carbon cycling in the oceans was so slow after an apparently sudden extinction event. In this paper, we show (using boron isotopes and Earth system modeling) that the impact caused rapid ocean acidification, and that the resulting ecological collapse in the oceans had long-lasting effects for global carbon cycling and climate. Our data suggest that impact, not volcanism, was key in driving end-Cretaceous mass extinction.

**Abstract**

Mass extinction at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary coincides with the Chicxulub bolide impact and also falls within the broader time frame of Deccan trap emplacement. Critically, though, empirical evidence as to how either of these factors could have driven observed extinction patterns and carbon cycle perturbations is still lacking. Here, using boron isotopes in foraminifera, we document a geologically rapid surface-ocean pH drop following the Chicxulub impact, supporting impact-induced ocean acidification as a mechanism for ecological collapse in the marine realm. Subsequently, surface water pH rebounded sharply with the extinction of marine calcifiers and the associated imbalance in the global carbon cycle. Our reconstructed water-column pH gradients, combined with Earth system modeling, indicate that a partial ∼50% reduction in global marine primary productivity is sufficient to explain observed marine carbon isotope patterns at the K-Pg, due to the underlying action of the solubility pump. While primary productivity recovered within a few tens of thousands of years, inefficiency in carbon export to the deep sea lasted much longer. This phased recovery scenario reconciles competing hypotheses previously put forward to explain the K-Pg carbon isotope records, and explains both spatially variable patterns of change in marine productivity across the event and a lack of extinction at the deep sea floor. In sum, we provide insights into the drivers of the last mass extinction, the recovery of marine carbon cycling in a postextinction world, and the way in which marine life imprints its isotopic signal onto the geological record.",Positive,Undefined

____

**Significance**

How the magnitude of El Niño will change is of great societal concern, yet it remains largely unknown. Here we show analysis of how changing El Niño properties, due to 20th century climate change, can shed light on changes to the intensity of El Niño in the future. Since the 1970s, El Niño has changed its origination from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific, along with increased strong El Niño events due to a background warming in the western Pacific warm pool. This suggests the controlling factors that may lead to increased extreme El Niño events in the future. If the observed background changes continue under future anthropogenic forcing, more frequent extreme El Niño events will induce profound socioeconomic consequences.

**Abstract**

El Niño’s intensity change under anthropogenic warming is of great importance to society, yet current climate models’ projections remain largely uncertain. The current classification of El Niño does not distinguish the strong from the moderate El Niño events, making it difficult to project future change of El Niño’s intensity. Here we classify 33 El Niño events from 1901 to 2017 by cluster analysis of the onset and amplification processes, and the resultant 4 types of El Niño distinguish the strong from the moderate events and the onset from successive events. The 3 categories of El Niño onset exhibit distinct development mechanisms. We find El Niño onset regime has changed from eastern Pacific origin to western Pacific origin with more frequent occurrence of extreme events since the 1970s. This regime change is hypothesized to arise from a background warming in the western Pacific and the associated increased zonal and vertical sea-surface temperature (SST) gradients in the equatorial central Pacific, which reveals a controlling factor that could lead to increased extreme El Niño events in the future. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models’ projections demonstrate that both the frequency and intensity of the strong El Niño events will increase significantly if the projected central Pacific zonal SST gradients become enhanced. If the currently observed background changes continue under future anthropogenic forcing, more frequent strong El Niño events are anticipated. The models’ uncertainty in the projected equatorial zonal SST gradients, however, remains a major roadblock for faithful prediction of El Niño’s future changes.",Positive,Global stance

Generally, Consider the impacts of arctic amplification - expect your area to warm 1.5-2x the global average land temperature. Greater impact of droughts (And perhaps flash droughts) or longer droughts, Forests fires (if there's forest around you) increasing in rate and severity, early frosts out of nowhere, or false-springs, etc. Expect temperature and humidity levels to surpass the optimal for many crops - potatoes, corn, wheat, etc- during heat waves that are longer and hotter over time. 

Also, keep in that the impacts of both mitigation and adaptation. A carbon tax will need to be seriously implemented at some point (not this piddly thing the Libs have implemented) - this will mean the current tax will need to increase at 8-10% y/y, starting soon, and going for decades. The IPCC puts forward numbers such as ~$2,000 / ton by 2050 (Or ~ $600/ton by 2030) imagine how that would impact your operation? Also, The medium-long term impact on the availability of heavy steel machinery (need lots of fossil fuels, global trade networks, exploitation of child slaves, etc) is doubtful in a world that seriously tries to effect climate action. Also, your nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers are likely from the Haber-Bosch and phosphate rock mining industries - both heavily dependent and reliant on fossil fuels - expect these to increase in price greatly, or reduce in availability (or both!). Look at moving to local fertilization, crop rotation, silvopasture, etc methods (if you're not already) in order to localize your supply chain as a buffer against market and resource instabilities caused by climate change. Expect it to become harder - when have changes ever been good for farmers? The rest of society undervalues the role of agriculture and food production.  

On the adaptation side, extensive water capture and storage facilities would be highly suggested, as you will be facing increasingly severe (And possibly lengthy) droughts. Not sure if you have an aquifer there, and how it's projected stores are looking if so. I know wells are becoming harder to depend on - my family has 3 sections in Alberta (for over 100 yrs now) and our 5th well (200ft) just ran dry. Shipping in water for the cattle weekly now.  Expect this, but more and worse. Local resilience and redundancy for basic needs - feed, water, drought-resistant crops, etc. will be key. Diversify crops and terrains - try some multi-layered perennial food forests, some machine-harvest ready crops, some drought-resistant crops, greenhouse crops, mushrooms, semi-tropical fruits) etc. The classics won't work anymore, and adaptation, breeding, and diversification will be the name in the game in insulating yourself from climate chaos caused production shocks. 

On the other hand, there could be some benefits. There will likely be more extensive carbon capture and sequestration projects put into place - perhaps there will be more carbon credits for increasing terrestrial sequestration, or reforesting part of your land, etc. I know there are carbon credits in Alberta to do with seed drills already - this could expand, and those with lots of land will be a prime target for such endeavors.",Positive,Undefined

,2019,10,How accurately can the climate sensitivity to CO2 be estimated from historical climate change?,"From the Abstract:

""The real-world variations mean that historical EffCS underestimates CO2CO2 EffCS by 30% when considering the entire historical period. The difference for recent decades implies that either unforced variability or the response to volcanic forcing causes a much stronger regional pattern of sea surface temperature change in the real world than in AOGCMs. We speculate that this could be explained by a deficiency in simulated coupled atmosphere–ocean feedbacks which reinforce the pattern (resembling the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in some respects) that causes the low EffCS. We conclude that energy-balance estimates of CO2CO2 EffCS are most accurate from periods unaffected by volcanic forcing. Atmosphere GCMs provided with observed sea surface temperature for the 1920s to the 1950s, which was such a period, give a range of about 2.0–4.5 K, agreeing with idealised CO2CO2 AOGCM experiments; the consistency is a reason for confidence in this range as an estimate of CO2CO2 EffCS. Unless another explosive volcanic eruption occurs, the first 30 years of the present century may give a more accurate energy-balance historical estimate of this quantity.""",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Abstract**

Production of animal protein is associated with high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Globally, oyster aquaculture is increasing as a way to meet growing demands for protein, yet its associated GHG-emissions are largely unknown. We quantified oyster aquaculture GHG-emissions from the three main constituents of GHG-release associated with terrestrial livestock production: fermentation in the animal gut, manure management, and fodder production. We found that oysters release no methane (CH4) and only negligible amounts of nitrous oxide (0.00012 ± 0.00004 μmol N2O gDW–1 hr–1) and carbon dioxide (3.556 ± 0.471 μmol CO2 gDW–1 hr–1). Further, sediment fluxes of N2O and CH4 were unchanged in the presence of oyster aquaculture, regardless of the length of time it had been in place. Sediment CO2 release was slightly stimulated between 4 and 6 years of aquaculture presence and then returned to baseline levels but was not significantly different between aquaculture and a control site when all ages of culture were pooled. There is no GHG-release from oyster fodder production. Considering the main drivers of GHG-release in terrestrial livestock systems, oyster aquaculture has less than 0.5% of the GHG-cost of beef, small ruminants, pork, and poultry in terms of CO2-equivalents per kg protein, suggesting that shellfish aquaculture may provide a a low GHG alternative for future animal protein production compared to land based sources. We estimate that if 10% of the protein from beef consumption in the United States was replaced with protein from oysters, the GHG savings would be equivalent to 10.8 million fewer cars on the road.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Significance**

Climate change—especially accelerated warming and drying—threatens to increase extinction risk, yet there is little evidence that physiological limitations have contributed to species declines. This study links species-specific water requirements for cooling body temperature to the collapse of a Mojave Desert bird community over the past century from climate change. Species occupying the hottest, driest sites were less likely to persist. Birds with the greatest water requirements for cooling their body temperature experienced the largest declines. Large-bodied carnivores and insectivores were especially vulnerable to cooling costs because they obtain water primarily from their food. Climate warming increases the evaporative cooling demand for birds, which will affect geographic patterns in body size and future extinction risk.

**Abstract**

Climate change threatens global biodiversity by increasing extinction risk, yet few studies have uncovered a physiological basis of climate-driven species declines. Maintaining a stable body temperature is a fundamental requirement for homeothermic animals, and water is a vital resource that facilitates thermoregulation through evaporative cooling, especially in hot environments. Here, we explore the potential for thermoregulatory costs to underlie the community collapse of birds in the Mojave Desert over the past century in response to climate change. The probability of persistence was lowest for species occupying the warmest and driest sites, which imposed the greatest cooling costs. We developed a general model of heat flux to evaluate whether water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to species’ declines by simulating thermoregulatory costs in the Mojave Desert for 50 bird species representing the range of observed declines. Bird species’ declines were positively associated with climate-driven increases in water requirements for evaporative cooling and exacerbated by large body size, especially for species with animal-based diets. Species exhibiting reductions in body size across their range saved up to 14% in cooling costs and experienced less decline than species without size reductions, suggesting total cooling costs as a mechanism underlying Bergmann’s rule. Reductions in body size, however, are unlikely to offset the 50 to 78% increase in cooling costs threatening desert birds from future climate change. As climate change spreads warm, dry conditions across the planet, water requirements are increasingly likely to drive population declines, providing a physiological basis for climate-driven extinctions.",Positive,Undefined

If Elon Musk diverted his attention from putting people on Mars to placing a relatively large controllable satellite lens or group of satellite lenses in geosynchronous orbit close to the sun (say, in the planet Mercury's orbital path):

A) how much light would these need to let pass though to offset 450 ppm CO2 warming down to 350 ppm? In other words, is there a W/M^(2) 'coefficient' from incoming long-wave radiation transfer to GHG affecting short wave radiation, averaged across the different surfaces of the earth? For example,350 is 77.77% of 450, so would this hypothetical lens need to block 22.23% of incoming solar radiation to achieve the effect of dropping from 350 ppm to 450 ppm?

B) Photosynthesis requires long spectrum radiation (blue light) that not even clouds can block. Would blocking a certain amount of this incoming light reduce plant and algae CO2 uptake enough that it would neutralize any positive benefits from preventing this light from becoming short-wave radiation on earth? Is there more incoming long spectrum radiation than plants can use per square cm of leaf surface? I realize most of this long wave radiation is reflected or absorbed as heat by the surface of the earth: this is a question of do plants get more light than they need, so that as planetary thermostat managers we could afford to block a little incoming sunlight without sacrificing too much food production, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services?

2. It works where you have air changing altitude.

Yes, in the usual state without a temperature inversion.
 
The general rule is that outgoing IR will be the 4th power of temperature, but you have to use absolute temperature.  For 0 and 10C, we have (283/273)^4 =1.15= 15 percent more.  The actual is less due to the atmosphere being more transparent at wavelengths a bit longer than the peak than a bit shorter, cloud heights going up with temperature, and disappearance of low clouds with increased temperature.
Increased outgoing IR is a factor in setting maximum 2m temperatures, but not the largest one.  Once you heat the air enough to induce convection, you basically have to heat the whole air column to hear it farther, and you end up being limited mostly heat transfer to the upper troposphere.",Positive,Undefined

So are you sure you would like a debate with me?

I partly just used Shakhova as an example, but she is a good one. In her famous 2008 paper, Natalia Shakhova found that a large portion of the methane hydrates in the ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) were unstable. She had observational evidence for this. When she came back, she was almost ridiculed by the scientific community as models had shown that these hydrates were not unstable. And there came an interesting conundrum of observations Vs models. As Dr Peter Wadhams, another Arctic expert said, observational evidence shod be the gold standard in this case. So, Natalia Shakhova found that these hydrates were, and I quote, ""highly possible for abrupt release at any time"". 


&gt;methane release in the arctic isn't from warming waters but from a deep geological process

The reason why doesn't really matter (it can do as it can change the speed of release but still), it matters that methane will be released.

Edit: Also, we have evidence that warming is having a large impact on the these methane hydrates, causing them to disassociate.

&gt;the methane release is nowhere near as much as they claimed

Shakhova wrote a paper discussing the issues in other papers that discuss methane release from the Arctic. I will link it if you like. There was a lot of talk that the methane release would be so deep, no methane would enter the atmosphere.

I will go into more detail, but she is an amazing example of how a life's work has been almost disregarded by the scientific community due to a skewed method of evaluation.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law is based on the idea that the Earth acts as a [black body.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) This means that it is simplified to act as a perfect absorber of energy. This is on a large scale a really decent approximation to make. It is also derived under the assumption that energy into the earth = energy that is radiated by the Earth, which is another huge assumption. In fact, this is generally true averaged over a long period of time but often (if ever) true on a day to day basis. Under those assumptions, you're right in saying that a hot Earth is better at transferring heat/energy into space. However, the climate system is much more complicated than a broad and simplifying law. It depends on everything from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to cloud cover and the water cycle. (you can read more about Earth's energy budget [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget) \- there is even a good info-graph) I'm not personally sure if you are correct as day-to-day (and nightly) averages go but there are more accurate equations out there to describe Earth's climate than the S-B law.

The IPCC determines the credibility of a theory in climate science by essentially seeing how many papers have been published on it, and that is terrible!

For example, Natalia Shakhova has dedicated her career to studying methane release in the Arctic. She is THE expert in this field. But seeing as there are only a few papers, it isn't considered by the IPCC.

The most important theories will be as a result of a life's work. Someone may have gotten their PhD in a niche, and spend their life studying that niche. Therefore there will only be a few papers on them, but therefore it's a weak theory according to the IPCC.

I do agree that economists should be left out of the IPCC report in 2021. But I would also like to see them completely restructure their organisation. Possibly with very technocratic departments. For example, if there is a paper that has discovered a new structural fault in an ice sheet, glaciologists can figure out it's credibility. To an extent, that is what already happens, but we need to shift the focus away from the number of papers to the quality of the papers.

Obviously it is not just quantity, but a niche topic with only a handful of papers on it will probably not be considered by the IPCC.

**Disclaimer** \-I don't want to get into debating the merits of geoengineering, this is just to get a better understanding of climate science framed in a geoengineering hyptothetical.

If Elon Musk diverted his attention from putting people on Mars to placing a relatively large controllable satellite lens or group of satellite lenses in geosynchronous orbit close to the sun (say, in the planet Mercury's orbital path):

A) how much light would these need to let pass though to offset 450 ppm CO2 warming down to 350 ppm? In other words, is there a W/M^(2) 'coefficient' from incoming long-wave radiation transfer to GHG affecting short wave radiation, averaged across the different surfaces of the earth? For example,350 is 77.77% of 450, so would this hypothetical lens need to block 22.23% of incoming solar radiation to achieve the effect of dropping from 350 ppm to 450 ppm?

B) Photosynthesis requires long spectrum radiation (blue light) that not even clouds can block. Would blocking a certain amount of this incoming light reduce plant and algae CO2 uptake enough that it would neutralize any positive benefits from preventing this light from becoming short-wave radiation on earth? Is there more incoming long spectrum radiation than plants can use per square cm of leaf surface? I realize most of this long wave radiation is reflected or absorbed as heat by the surface of the earth: this is a question of do plants get more light than they need, so that as planetary thermostat managers we could afford to block a little incoming sunlight without sacrificing too much food production, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services?

c) Would blocking incoming long wave radiation produce changes to weather patterns due to less differential heating from the equator to the poles? Assuming the lens is uniformly transparent, would this be a problem?",2019,9,Space parasol thought experiment,"L1 isn't stable, it's unstable like a marble on a hill: If you get closer to the Sun or the Earth its gravity becomes stronger and you fall down.

**Abstract**

Supraglacial lakes are important to ice sheet mass balance because their development and drainage has been linked to changes in ice flow velocity and ice shelf disintegration. However, little is known about their distribution on the world’s largest ice sheet in East Antarctica. Here, we use ~5 million km^(2) of high-resolution satellite imagery to identify &gt;65,000 lakes (&gt;1,300 km^(2)) that formed around the peak of the melt season in January 2017. Lakes occur in most marginal areas where they typically develop at low elevations (&lt;100 m) and on low surface slopes (&lt;1°), but they can exist 500 km inland and at elevations &gt;1500 m. We find that lakes often cluster a few kilometres down-ice from grounding lines and ~60% (&gt;80% by area) develop on ice shelves, including some potentially vulnerable to collapse driven by lake-induced hydro-fracturing. This suggests that parts of the ice sheet may be highly sensitive to climate warming.",Negative,Undefined

**Abstract**

Earth is heading towards a climate that last existed more than three million years ago (Ma) during the ‘mid-Pliocene warm period’, when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were about 400 parts per million, global sea level oscillated in response to orbital forcing, and peak global-mean sea level (GMSL) may have reached about 20 metres above the present-day value. For sea-level rise of this magnitude, extensive retreat or collapse of the Greenland, West Antarctic and marine-based sectors of the East Antarctic ice sheets is required. Yet the relative amplitude of sea-level variations within glacial–interglacial cycles remains poorly constrained. To address this, we calibrate a theoretical relationship between modern sediment transport by waves and water depth, and then apply the technique to grain size in a continuous 800-metre-thick Pliocene sequence of shallow-marine sediments from Whanganui Basin, New Zealand. Water-depth variations obtained in this way, after corrections for tectonic subsidence, yield cyclic relative sea-level (RSL) variations. Here we show that sea level varied on average by 13 ± 5 metres over glacial–interglacial cycles during the middle-to-late Pliocene (about 3.3–2.5 Ma). The resulting record is independent of the global ice volume proxy (as derived from the deep-ocean oxygen isotope record) and sea-level cycles are in phase with 20-thousand-year (kyr) periodic changes in insolation over Antarctica, paced by eccentricity-modulated orbital precession between 3.3 and 2.7 Ma. Thereafter, sea-level fluctuations are paced by the 41-kyr period of cycles in Earth’s axial tilt as ice sheets stabilize on Antarctica and intensify in the Northern Hemisphere. Strictly, we provide the amplitude of RSL change, rather than absolute GMSL change. However, simulations of RSL change based on glacio-isostatic adjustment show that our record approximates eustatic sea level, defined here as GMSL unregistered to the centre of the Earth. Nonetheless, under conservative assumptions, our estimates limit maximum Pliocene sea-level rise to less than 25 metres and provide new constraints on polar ice-volume variability under the climate conditions predicted for this century.",Positive,Undefined

_____

**Abstract**

Mega-heatwaves are among the deadliest natural disasters in midlatitudes. During such events, the atmospheric circulation is typically governed by persistent anticyclones, enabling cloud-free conditions and advection of hot air. Dry soils in heatwave regions are also known to further contribute to the escalation of air temperatures. However, while local land–atmosphere feedbacks are well studied, the same does not apply to the influence of upwind areas, from where heat is advected. Here we investigate reanalysis data using a Lagrangian heat-tracking model to unravel the role of upwind land–atmosphere feedbacks during the two European mega-heatwaves of this century: the events in 2003 and 2010. Our analysis indicates that advected sensible heat can come in torrents, suddenly and intensely, leading to abrupt increases in air temperatures that further strengthen local land–atmosphere feedbacks via soil desiccation. During both mega-heatwaves, about 30% of the advected sensible heat was caused by the drought upwind. Since subtropical droughts are projected to aggravate during this century, in light of our results, this may be accompanied by consequent intensification of midlatitude mega-heatwaves. We therefore recommend considering not only local, but also upwind land cover and land-use management in the design of adaptation strategies against compound drought–heatwave events.",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

Quantifying ancient atmospheric pCO2 provides valuable insights into the interplay between greenhouse gases and global climate. Beyond the 800-ky history uncovered by ice cores, discrepancies in both the trend and magnitude of pCO2 changes remain among different proxy-derived results. The traditional paleosol pCO2 paleobarometer suffers from largely unconstrained soil-respired CO2 concentration (S(z)). Using finely disseminated carbonates precipitated in paleosols from the Chinese Loess Plateau, here we identified that their S(z) can be quantitatively constrained by soil magnetic susceptibility. Based on this approach, we reconstructed pCO2 during 2.6–0.9 Ma, which documents overall low pCO2 levels (&lt;300 ppm) comparable with ice core records, indicating that the Earth system has operated under late Pleistocene pCO2 levels for an extended period. The pCO2 levels do not show statistically significant differences across the mid-Pleistocene Transition (ca. 1.2–0.8 Ma), suggesting that CO2 is probably not the driver of this important climate change event.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Targets and accounting for negative emissions should be explicitly set and managed separately from existing and future targets for emissions reduction. Failure to make such a separation has already hampered climate policy, exaggerating the expected future contribution of negative emissions in climate models, while also obscuring the extent and pace of the investment needed to deliver negative emissions. Separation would help minimize the negative impacts that promises and deployments of negative emissions could have on emissions reduction, arising from effects such as temporal trade-offs, excessive offsetting, and technological lock-in. Benefits for international, national, local, organizational, and sectoral planning would arise from greater clarity over the role and timing of negative emissions alongside accelerated emissions reduction.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

A slightly older paper but a very interesting paper nevertheless, I found it doing research for my upcoming posts on geoengineering.

As the Arctic ice melts, its reflectivity or albedo will decrease. This means that the exposed ocean will warm up more as a result of increased absorption of sunlight. This causes a positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---&gt; Warmer ocean water causes more ice to melt ---&gt; More ice gets melted ---&gt; Rinse and repeat.

However, it was believed that this would create a possible upside. Warmer oceans would allow phytoplankton to grow. As the phytoplankton grows, it will absorb carbon dioxide and therefore cool the earth down slightly. 

This paper shows that increased phytoplankton growth could amplify Arctic warming by 20%, causing devastating warming somewhere that is already warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth. This causes another positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---&gt; Warmer ocean water allows more phytoplankton to grow ---&gt; More phytoplankton growth leads to warmer ocean water and therefore less ice ---&gt; Rinse and repeat.

**Abstract**

The globally averaged calcite compensation depth has deepened by several hundred metres in the past 15 Myr. This deepening has previously been interpreted to reflect increased alkalinity supply to the ocean driven by enhanced continental weathering due to the Himalayan orogeny during the late Neogene period. Here we examine mass accumulation rates of the main marine calcifying groups and show that global accumulation of pelagic carbonates has decreased from the late Miocene epoch to the late Pleistocene epoch even though CaCO3 preservation has improved, suggesting a decrease in weathering alkalinity input to the ocean, thus opposing expectations from the Himalayan uplift hypothesis. Instead, changes in relative contributions of coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera to the pelagic carbonates in relative shallow sites, where dissolution has not taken its toll, suggest that coccolith production in the euphotic zone decreased concomitantly with the reduction in weathering alkalinity inputs as registered by the decline in pelagic carbonate accumulation. Our work highlights a mechanism whereby, in addition to deep-sea dissolution, changes in marine calcification acted to modulate carbonate compensation in response to reduced weathering linked to the late Neogene cooling and decline in atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide.",Negative,Undefined

**Disclaimer** \-I don't want to get into debating the merits of geoengineering, this is just to get a better understanding of climate science framed in a geoengineering hyptothetical.

If Elon Musk diverted his attention from putting people on Mars to placing a relatively large controllable satellite lens or group of satellite lenses in geosynchronous orbit close to the sun (say, in the planet Mercury's orbital path):

A) how much light would these need to let pass though to offset 450 ppm CO2 warming down to 350 ppm? In other words, is there a W/M^(2) 'coefficient' from incoming long-wave radiation transfer to GHG affecting short wave radiation, averaged across the different surfaces of the earth? For example,350 is 77.77% of 450, so would this hypothetical lens need to block 22.23% of incoming solar radiation to achieve the effect of dropping from 350 ppm to 450 ppm?

B) Photosynthesis requires long spectrum radiation (blue light) that not even clouds can block. Would blocking a certain amount of this incoming light reduce plant and algae CO2 uptake enough that it would neutralize any positive benefits from preventing this light from becoming short-wave radiation on earth? Is there more incoming long spectrum radiation than plants can use per square cm of leaf surface? I realize most of this long wave radiation is reflected or absorbed as heat by the surface of the earth: this is a question of do plants get more light than they need, so that as planetary thermostat managers we could afford to block a little incoming sunlight without sacrificing too much food production, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services?

c) Would blocking incoming long wave radiation produce changes to weather patterns due to less differential heating from the equator to the poles?

A bit of an old one, but it seems every interesting. As you all hopefully know, DMS (dimethylsulphide) essentially cools the atmosphere. DMS is produced by phytoplankton, this study shows that due to ocean acidification (OA), DMS production will decrease, causing an increase in temperature up to 0.48°C.

As you can see in the graph above my text, the trend might either be very sharp, or more shallow, a more dramatic drop might be very bad, meaning that OA will cause a large decrease in DMS and thus a boost to global warming.


This is an interesting mechanism, not included by current models.

However, the jury is still out, this paper shows that while OA will decrease DMS production, warming will increase it.

Infrared radiation of heat.

I build homes in the mtn of Colorado 

We are one of the climates that show temp changes more intensely than others.
Being high altitude and low humidity we experience night sky radiation at very high rates.
A surface that is exposed to the sky at night, like a roof, can get far cooler than ambient temperature.
The heat from a given surface is radiated to space per thermo dynamics. We see this all the time with dew point as well, the roof of a car will cool to see or frost point before the sides.
The gh effect of co2 is at it's full potential when there is little moisture in the air.
For us, the humify has stayed low but the co2 has increased. 
We have seen a tremendous change in our typical cold winter weather. 
30 years ago we routinely had cold snaps that stayed 20 or 30 below zero. 

Now we seldom see 20 below.
Is there any chance that this change in nightly lows is an isolated effect of atmospheric co2 or does it just blend in with the planet climate as a whole.

Anyone that's been to Colorado recently has seen all the dead trees 
These trees are being killed by spruce beetles, a bug that used to die off every time we had a cold snap.

I discovered the night sky radiation effect with home climate modeling software called WUFI.

The one data set that showed warming was computed temperature based on wind shere, which seemed weak.",2019,9,Troposphere temps,"&gt;Why dose the ocean absorb co2 sometimes and release it during others.  Both situations being a warming ocean.

Because the current global warming is being cause by extra CO2 released in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is thus saturated in CO2 relative to the ocean and so the ocean has to absorb some of it to reach equilibrium. However, the rate at which it absorbs CO2 is slightly slowed by the fact that the oceans themselves are warming and warmer oceans hold less dissolved gas. In the end, human emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere wins out that battle and so in the net, the oceans are still taking up CO2. It is thought that this could swing the other way and the ocean could become a net source of CO2 if human emissions decline but the ocean continues to warm.

The case of ice age cycling from a cold climate to a warm climate is different. There, the initial perturbation is not the emission of fossil fuel CO2 but instead perturbing a state from equilibrium by a slow warming due to changes in Earth's orbit. This slow warming eventually causes a warming of the ocean, which outgasses some of its CO2, which leads to more warming, etc (it's a positive feedback).",Positive,Undefined

That's not correct, (even if it is a constant talking point on in the skepticsphere). You might have seen skeptics' plots that ended about 5-10 years ago? In any case, let's plot the satellite data up to August 2019 (the most recent available).

We can even do as skeptics do and start the trend from the unprecedented El Niño warm year 1998 (not a correct thing to do). Even so, there is still a warming trend in both the RSS and UAH datasets (the two most common satellite datasets).

[https://i.imgur.com/JE1bGvt.png](https://i.imgur.com/JE1bGvt.png)

I've listed the raw data sources below so you can check these trends yourself if you're inclined. 

RSS: [http://images.remss.com/data/msu/graphics/TLT\_v40/time\_series/RSS\_TS\_channel\_TLT\_Global\_Land\_And\_Sea\_v04\_0.txt](http://images.remss.com/data/msu/graphics/TLT_v40/time_series/RSS_TS_channel_TLT_Global_Land_And_Sea_v04_0.txt)

The next question might be: why is there a different trend rate between the two satellite datasets? 

Although there is a lot of assumptions that go into modelling the temperature seen from satellites (you can read the details on RSS [here](http://www.remss.com/measurements/upper-air-temperature/) and UAH [here](https://www.drroyspencer.com/2015/04/version-6-0-of-the-uah-temperature-dataset-released-new-lt-trend-0-11-cdecade/), I think the main difference might be that UAH captures higher up in the troposphere, and even some of the stratosphere (which is cooling) hence has lower warming trend.

.....that was my initial reaction and based on that, it’s safe to say this is a mad man’s edict. 

Hydroelectric power has been stalled again and again; however the theory remains with untapped potential. I, along with the masses, don’t posses the capacity or capability to construct these possibilities.

You do recall correctly that hydroelectric power is far smaller in real life than my theory. We are talking GLOBAL change, but first we need a working project. With governments flaking on major projects after promising millions, just to see them fail, it’s hard to evaluate. I’ll reply with the link tomorrow. Scotland made bold statements regarding their future projects and ambitions to Achieve pure sustainable energy sources. Including hydroelectric power...I’m loving it. (I don’t eat at McDeforestation of the Amazon rainforest, the line just fit).

Hydroelectric power - chew on it! The tides are constant. The Gulf Stream and others are constant. Think of the feats made which were thought impossible only years prior!! Routing the energy to a major city like NYC - that’s ONE step...

Environmental impact? Mf listen, we can incorporate a layer of filters of varying sizes and mediums to filter out ocean life with minimal impact AND eliminate the need for dependency on batteries that don’t exist to match this framework. (Batteries mentioned here against the main argument for solar or wind for harnessing energy during the “low” periods)

Rather than the idea to dismantle the nuclear arsenal (reduce the enrichment from 90+% to 5%) and fuel a city like LA for a decade (I can provide the link with math tomorrow) let’s look at a long term solution. For the 2000 nukes in US arsenal (deployed, another 2000 reserve) it would fuel LA for 7.8 year according to a Stanford study.  

More realistic and sustainable,

Water is literally essential to life - not to quote Zoolander. But we have to harness this sustainable resource if possible rather than burning coal to dissipate the atmosphere. 

Focus on TESTING and SUPPORTING hydroelectric experiments in terms of GLOBAL SOLUTIONS rather than fighting wars over our ever-decreasing oil reserves. 

Combine hydroelectric power on the waters to assist with wind farms and solar tech, use what Earth provides rather than depleting the planet. 

Thank you for supporting my energy!! no need to debate my delivery. I’m no face of a movement or voice of inspiration but surely a far more educated individual can invoke change or test these ideas!

1. We don’t actually know what we’re doing. And honestly I’m not sure we can get there. Why? Global climate systems are intricately tied into myriad global ecological, chemical, and physical systems. I fact, those three comprise what we call “climate”. We do not, and I would argue, adequately understand all the direct and indirect consequences of tinkering with those systems. 

The risk: accidentally making things worse, at a global scale. And not being able to “fix it”. So many ecological systems are already under tremendous strain, I’m concerned such an “accident” could tip more species and ecosystems into catastrophic crashes, which would ultimately harm people (not to mention plant and animal) in unprecedented ways. 

2. Hubris. I argue that we,as a species, need to stop thinking and acting like the natural world is something we can or should control. Not only because it’s not realistic, but also because the costs of managing and administering the system outpace our efforts fast. Case study: our current predicament. Read up on some Victorian era opinions about “improving the natural world” for additional details. Also, it’s not just a western phenomenon, but that’s a whole course in “philosophies of nature”, which I recommend if you have the opportunity. 

3. Simple opportunity cost. Large scale geo-engineering would take a tremendous amount of resources. I’ve never seen a proposal that would not, regardless of what a sales narrative might claim. I argue that there are better uses of those resources for both climate mitigation and general human well being. Anyone selling these solutions could become very very wealthy, and frankly the last thing we need are more billionaires. 

Please note that I apply these to technological geo-engineering. Restoring habitat, adjusting industrial systems, and land management practices are large-scale geo-engineering schemes. I would consider them a lot more seriously then some fantabulous new technology with endless possibilities. After all, like the internet itself, endless possibilities include special new hells.",Positive,Undefined

,2019,9,"Geothermal energy has a surprisingly high potential as a clean energy source, at best it might be able to provide our entire electricity need","i think its important to advocate for 100% energy to the public.  but to sit down now and try to figure out the cost of 100% is an absurd task.  solar and batteries both just dropped 90% in price in a decade.  its going to take at least another decade to get to 95% in a small number of countries.  by then, solar+wind+energy storage+smart grid+energy effeicency+etc is going to equal nearly a century's worth of innovation compared to what we have recently experienced.  the rate of innovation is accelerating.  moreover, its not just a few countries working on it.  every single country that matters is installing renewable energy and contributing to R&amp;D  

we literally have supercomputers modeling millions of different chemistries for better storage.  There are so many ways improve storage.

with the technology we have today we could get to 95% renewable energy and save money.  however, the costs are going to fall significantly.

solar industry is brutal.  way more are going to fail than make it.  all the money long-term is going to be in storage and managing the grid.  I cannot begin to explain how simple solar is to manufacture and install.

Yeah you are totally correct that more energy needed than being produced is bullshit. Maybe better would be that the energy equivalent of what was required to produce it, compared to the energy output is not as high as compared to fossil fuel energy.   


And to your comment of 2013 being old sources, I totally agree, but I found different sources from 2018 which more or less seem to agree to the previous findings (there were even more judging by a quick look at the abstracts, but who got the time to read all of them)

  
Zhou, Z., &amp; Carbajales-Dale, M. (2018). Assessing the photovoltaic  technology landscape: efficiency and energy return on investment  (EROI). *Energy &amp; Environmental Science*, *11*(3), 603-608

  
this paper looks only at PV technology (specifically searched for it because PV is my concern)   
Fig 3 gives a representation of different PV technology and the EROI factor. On the left with the high balance of system cost scenario, again the relative low EROI values are represented like in other studies.

Here is a website from a german professor who lists the EROI for different PV technology, and the values don't differ too significantly  
[https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php](https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php)

Trainer, T. (2018). Estimating the EROI of whole systems for 100%  renewable electricity supply capable of dealing with intermittency. *Energy policy*, *119*, 648-653  
Also very interesting, but not specifically concerned with PV. But the conclusion (which is restricted to Australia of course) basically says that 100% renewable can't function with our current demand.

Hall, C. A., Lambert, J. G., &amp; Balogh, S. B. (2014). EROI of different fuels and the implications for society. *Energy policy*, *64*, 141-152  
Also last but not least, this paper again is older but their discussion at least from 6.4, renewable energy sources and 7 policy implications resonate too well with my concern that maybe technology will not be our salvation this time.

I mean, in Europe the planned solution was to buy emission certificates through the Emission Trading System (ETS). While in principle not a bad idea, a lot of critics are saying that as long as this is not a world wide policy, it doesn't improve anything. As long as there is a world market for fossil fuel, as soon as one nation tries to reduce their usage of fossil fuel, the demand decreases which leads to a lower price which makes it more attractive for other nations.

I mean, this can't be an excuse to say ok, why even bother to change because somebody else is going to pollute anyway? But still, I think a point is being made there. Because the goal should be to reduce emissions and even if america and germany e.g. reduce their emissions, it doesn't really matter if world wide the net emissions doesn't decrease. And considering that even scientists seem to have some concerns about a 100% switch to renewables, we shouldn't..rush it? Because this could lead to (unnecessary?) economic damage? Or even more important, talk about the other side of the equation which is our demand and life style? And even darker and more prohibited to talk about, the amount of people with even more growth expected in the future, which would lead to even more energy demand etc.

And to return to the OP question - it is very unclear if any credible scenario could result in melting of ALL ice in Antarctica - there is a vast region about 1000km from the South Pole and almost 1000 km in diameter where the bedrock altitude is about 2000m and total altitude including ice is about 4000m - that ice will never melt in any realistic scenario.

“Eocene was the last time the world was totally globally warmed to worldwide tropical conditions with palms and crocodiles and cone shells and nautiloid cephalopods spanning the globe, a time when there was absolutely no ice at the poles and snow was something limited to the highest mountains only, a world where once again palm trees, tropical mollusks, and basking crocodilians will be able to make a living in places like Canada or northern Europe, as the world once again becomes a tropical paradise.” Pg. 173

The real money for energy is going to be made in storage and intelligent transmission of energy.  The internet of things is going to be so important in developing a smart grid.  

one other random thing.  offshore wind is going to be a decent size player in energy.  that because its capacity factor is so high.  we are talking 50-70% capacity factor for offshore, compared to 30-50% for onshore.  capacity factor is simply a measure of how often its producing full power.  with 50-70% you are going to need a lot less storage.  offshore is more expensive than onshore for now, but its more valuable because its more consistent.",Positive,Undefined

Yes

  is it affordable compared to wind+solar+energy storage?

**NO!!!!!!!!**

It will be a niche technology.  it works well in a few places that have incredible geothermal activity near the surface.  however, wind+solar+storage is so much cheaper and will get even cheaper.  

I am concerned geothermal often gets touted as a distraction.  solar keeps falling 10% per year, and energy storage even faster.  getting to 80% wind and solar takes hardly any storage.  going from 80% to 100% will take much more storage, but the price of storage will be so much cheaper when we get to 80%.",Positive,Undefined

I do agree with you that it's not the easiest one to alter. There's also not a lot of potential for the proposed solutions (deep ocean CO2 injection and iron fertilization). Blue carbon is probably the safest and most straight forward, but only has a sequestration potential of roughly 0.1PgC/yr, which is tiny relative to the anthropogenic emissions of 10+ PgC/yr.

I’m not an earth scientist (more of a philosopher, if anything), but i would say that we need at least three things: store, pressure and release.  We’re already storing the CO2, so I guess that leaves us with pressure and release. 

What i was thinking about is the possibility of creating something like a giant trumpet that would channel at least some of the CO2 towards the outside of the planet. I even thought it could perhaps be done with all the plastic that we’ve been accumulating, so that we at least put it to good use... There’s even a project collecting plastic waste from the ocean, perhaps a team could arise from this (?), the ones pick up the trash, the others use it for the construction... 

I wonder... What is heavier, CO2 or O2? Because if we could “filter” the CO2 from the O2, we could work with their densities to release more of the toxic elements and keep more of the good ones. Kind of like the way in which the body is able to separate the two when we breathe.. (I guess some of that technology already exists? check [here](https://sciencenordic.com/climate-change-climate-solutions-iceland/the-machine-that-converts-carbon-dioxide-to-stone-in-iceland/1451455))

What i picture is something like a two-chamber construction, where we collect and filter the gases in the first chamber, and a second one where we propel what we want to release into the outside (and just for fun i would make it sound like a fart). I would also imagine that the “filter chamber” would work to keep “alien gases” from coming to the inside of the Earth (?). 

I realize there are many issues in the construction of a giant trumpet made out of trash... At the same time, many groups before us built incredible constructions with much less technology than we have now, so they just found a way to “figure things out”..

**Abstract**

The impacts of climate change on crop yields, as projected by a slew of impact assessments carried out since the 1980s, have brought the issue of future food insecurity to the fore. A meta-analysis of ~27 000 data points from studies published over the last four decades reveals that at country level, average impacts of climate change on crop yields up to the 2050s are generally small (but negative) for rice and wheat, and modest for maize, provided farmers adopt practices and technologies such as improved varieties, planting at optimal times, and improved water and fertilizer management. These technologies also have the potential to reduce differences across political, economic and climatic regions. Once these are adopted, climate change may not add significantly to the challenge of food production for the majority of countries except for some potential hotspots distributed around the world. Massive investment, policy, and institutional support will be needed, however, to facilitate adoption and scaling-out of such practices, and to address climatic variability.",Negative,Politics

They do, which is wonderful.  It also currently costs ~ $1,100/ton for sequestration. Obviously we'll see efficiency gains, but they would have to be significant to bring it within affordable levels. In addition, using waste heat would be interesting to see scaled out to the tens of thousands of plants needed to sequester enough carbon to make a difference. At that scale there *will* be significant impacts due to supply chain management and logistics/resource necessities.

Potentially, depending on what energy sources are used, etc (e.g. needs to be 100% renewable, as even NG isn't efficient enough to get a ""net negative"" result). Still, we don't account for most negative environmental externalities - so the cost on the land, water, and biosphere in other ways needs to be considered as well.

____

**Significance**

One of the greatest challenges in projecting the sea-level contributions of ice sheets over the next century is the lack of observations of conditions within and underneath the ice sheet that span more than a decade or two. By digitizing archival ice-penetrating radar data recorded in the 1970s on 35-mm optical film, we can compare modern and archival radar-sounding data at their full resolution in order to observe changes in the Antarctic ice sheet over more than 40 y. This makes it possible to investigate and model subsurface processes over both large scales and several decades for the first time.

**Abstract**

Airborne radar sounding can measure conditions within and beneath polar ice sheets. In Antarctica, most digital radar-sounding data have been collected in the last 2 decades, limiting our ability to understand processes that govern longer-term ice-sheet behavior. Here, we demonstrate how analog radar data collected over 40 y ago in Antarctica can be combined with modern records to quantify multidecadal changes. Specifically, we digitize over 400,000 line kilometers of exploratory Antarctic radar data originally recorded on 35-mm optical film between 1971 and 1979. We leverage the increased geometric and radiometric resolution of our digitization process to show how these data can be used to identify and investigate hydrologic, geologic, and topographic features beneath and within the ice sheet. To highlight their scientific potential, we compare the digitized data with contemporary radar measurements to reveal that the remnant eastern ice shelf of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica had thinned between 10 and 33% between 1978 and 2009. We also release the collection of scanned radargrams in their entirety in a persistent public archive along with updated geolocation data for a subset of the data that reduces the mean positioning error from 5 to 2.5 km. Together, these data represent a unique and renewed extensive, multidecadal historical baseline, critical for observing and modeling ice-sheet change on societally relevant timescales.",Positive,Undefined

____

**Abstract**

Reconstructing the evolution of sea level during past warmer epochs such as the Pliocene, provides unique insight into the response of sea level and ice sheets to prolonged warming. While estimates of global mean sea level (GMSL) during this time exist, they vary by several tens of metres, hindering the assessment of past and future ice sheet stability. Here we show that during the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period, which was on average 2–3 °C warmer than pre-industrial, the GMSL was 16.2 m (most likely, 5.6–19.2 m, 68% uncertainty range) higher than today. During the even warmer Pliocene Climatic Optimum (~4 °C warmer than pre-industrial), our results show that GMSL was 23.5 m above present (most probably, 9.0–26.7 m, 68% uncertainty range). We present six GMSL data points, ranging from 4.39 to 3.27 million years ago, that are based on phreatic overgrowths on speleothems from the western Mediterranean (Mallorca, Spain). This record is unique owing to its clear relationship to sea level, its reliable U–Pb ages and its long timespan, which allows us to quantify uncertainties on potential uplift. Our data indicate that ice sheets are very sensitive to warming and provide important calibration targets for future ice sheet models.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

In the last two decades Europe experienced a series of high‐impact heat extremes. We here assess observed trends in temperature extremes at ECA&amp;D stations in Europe. We demonstrate that on average across Europe the number of days with extreme heat and heat stress has more than tripled and hot extremes have warmed by 2.3 °C from 1950–2018. Over Central Europe, the warming exceeds the corresponding summer mean warming by 50%. Days with extreme cold temperatures have decreased by a factor of 2–3 and warmed by more than 3 °C, regionally substantially more than winter mean temperatures. Cold and hot extremes have warmed at about 94% of stations, a climate change signal that cannot be explained by internal variability. The clearest climate change signal can be detected in maximum heat stress. EURO‐CORDEX RCMs broadly capture observed trends but the majority underestimates the warming of hot extremes and overestimates the warming of cold extremes.",Negative,Undefined

I can't give all the answers, but there's a lot we can do, and can be done. The bulk of fossil fuels are still in the ground, and, most importantly- we're just getting started.

Numerous groups have been fighting for climate action and winning battles, there's been a dramatic shift in discourse on climate in the past year alone, and people are rising up to the challenge. Fast enough, perhaps not, but they're gaining more momentum. (See Fridays for Future/Citizen's Climate Lobby/350.org/The Global Climate Strike/Extinction Rebellion- just to name a few.) Joining up with any of them is a good way to combat despair. (And are what a lot of the scientists say has reinvigorated them.) This isn't a comprehensive list of everything, but it's a few of the big ones.

https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24672",2019,8,Greater future global warming inferred from Earth's recent energy budget,"Been keeping tabs on this thread since I was tagged in it repeatedly.

So, I actually checked into this paper about a week or so ago, and it's relating to a sensitivity difference from what I gathered. (More on that in the scientist comments below!)

&gt;Thus, in an effort to make the present work comparable to previous research, we also show the results of our procedure applied to a predictand of ECS values6. We find that the observationally informed ECS prediction has a mean value of 3.7 °C (with a 25–75% interval of 3.0 °C to 4.2 °C) and that 68% of the observationally informed distribution of ECS is above the raw model mean of 3.1 °C (Fig. 2e).

(for one reference!)

Carbon Brief discussed it 'briefly' in [this article](https://www.carbonbrief.org/new-study-reduces-uncertainty-climate-sensitivity), which also talks about another paper that was released after regarding lower ECS/sensitivity, and has comments from Brown from this paper.

Here's also a [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/12/06/the-most-accurate-climate-change-models-predict-the-most-alarming-consequences-study-claims/) with many comments from other scientists &amp; the authors about it.

More or less, it's about uncertainty (and as a result, our modeling, especially with clouds) but also helps provide a better picture overall. As always, more data is needed! 

There's also more nitty gritty from Brown's own website [here](https://patricktbrown.org/2017/11/29/greater-future-global-warming-inferred-from-earths-recent-energy-budget/), where he delves into it more.",Positive,Global stance

They are outdated, which makes them conservative, because the publish papers periodically, the science ""evolves"".

RCPs are brilliant, but they can be used for more than the IPCC give them credit.

Fine, whatever. They used data at the time, but that still means that they are conservative, maybe they weren't when they published, but they are now.

&gt;I have but this doesn't trump new papers on methane permafrost. You have a circlejerk in your own brain for Shakhova, read some new papers talking about the permafrost. This doesn't discredit anything I said. To use your own words ""read nature"". jfc. You can't pull a 6 year old paper over NEW research. You seem to largely forget that science evolves. There's a wealth of information on permafrost that's new, choosing to use slightly outdated science, while touting the IPCC is conservative is indicative of your stance. You really just like Shakhova. It's actually quite ironic.

Shakhova used observational evidence to prove that part of the methane reservoir was unstable, newer papers used models, who do we believe, models or observational data?

I don't really stand by Shakhova's claim that methane release could be instantaneous or that all 50GT would enter the atmosphere, but we know that part is unstable. And newer papers how that there might be even more carbon released than anticipated.",Positive,Global stance

Well his predictions are indicative of his expertise, so choosing to forget that is willful ignorance.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; But we know that the IPCC is too conservative on this front. GAC likelihood proves this. 

Conservative? No. Outdated? A little. Only recently has research picked up to really show that the IPCC is off a bit on SLR, but even then it's not *wildly* inaccurate. It's a bit conservative in some aspects (or outdated pick your poison) like methane release from permafrost, SLR, and the various effects of climate change like heatwaves. Not listening to the IPCC as conservative because they're a bit outdated or a tad conservative is probably one of the worst things you could do, because even with these conservative aspects they aren't wildy wrong, so their RCPs and the Models are still *really fucking good.* Could they be more accurate? Of course! And the next generation certainly will be. But from what we know, the new models aren't wildly different besides ECS which luckily isn't a near term issue.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; So my approval of Wadhams disproved everything I have to say?

\&gt;Read his papers, you will see that he is the expert, if your knowledge of Wadhams comes from the media:

Key word: Almost. If you actually read what I said, it doesn't make me ignore your opinion. And once again if you decided to read my words instead of assuming I haven't looked into Wadhams, I stated that he still generally knows what he's talking about of course. Just that using his predictions as evidence is underwhelming to say the very least.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; But the models are the most important, and even then, they don't include all the feedbacks, and they downplay them.

Once again a misrepresentation of the science. They didn't downplay them, they used the information available. And *even then* with these additions it's not like they're wildly inaccurate, so using these as evidence that the IPCC is just flat out wrong is asinine. And while the models are important you were convinced that the RCPs are just not worth much stock which is inaccurate. They have their issues of course, but you overplay them.

&gt;And if you'd go through u/ClimateNurse's page you'd know that the IPCC actually does include a lot of feedback loops, maybe not directly in the models but certainly in the literature especially when talking about the RCP scenarios. 

But the models are the most important, and even then, they don't include all the feedbacks, and they downplay them.


&gt;And I hate to break it to you, but even with methane permafrost release it doesn't go up by that much. More and more studies are popping up about it and the methane permafrost is not that bad when you consider that; when it melts its environment is a carbon sink in some places, methane's short lifespan (never reaching it's full potential), and that it likely won't actually effect warming much until after 2100. So basically many of these feedback loops we're seeing are more important for ECS than near term warming.

Read Shakhova et Al 2013.

&gt;Now if we're talking the 1% rule, there's a reason not many scientists are not as alarmed as you about it, but you choose to cherry pick the ones that are...

I think the IPCC made the correct decision when not using Shakhovas work in some aspects, and I think it makes sense considering what little research has not been indicative of an inevitable or likely major issue.

&gt;For many of us, the thundering onset of climate change is what woke us from our slumber. That is the hardest to ignore. The latest comprehensive view from the deeply conservative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) went something like this: 

&gt;**“Within the next 12 years, we just need to put aside all our differences and peacefully orchestrate a massive and abrupt slow-down of the world’s economy without destroying it. Meanwhile, we need to pull carbon out of the air with gadgets that haven’t been invented yet, or we’re fucked.”**

&gt;Maybe I shouldn’t have tried to make a living by campaigning on climate change. **Anyone who has made any serious attempt at following the logic through realises we are actually campaigning against industrial colonialist civilisation.

____

**Abstract**

The Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT), approximately 34 Ma ago, marks a period of major global cooling and inception of the Antarctic ice sheet. Proxies of deep circulation suggest a contemporaneous onset or strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Proxy evidence of gradual salinification of the North Atlantic and tectonically driven isolation of the Arctic suggest that closing the Arctic-Atlantic gateway could have triggered the AMOC at the EOT. We demonstrate this trigger of the AMOC using a new paleoclimate model with late Eocene boundary conditions. The control simulation reproduces Eocene observations of low Arctic salinities. Subsequent closure of the Arctic-Atlantic gateway triggers the AMOC by blocking freshwater inflow from the Arctic. Salt advection feedbacks then lead to cessation of overturning in the North Pacific. These circulation changes imply major warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, and simultaneous cooling of the North Pacific, but no interhemispheric change in temperatures.",Negative,Undefined

&gt;What changes are going to hit us the hardest? What are some of the ""pills"" that'll be the hardest to swallow because of what we are doing to our planet?

Most notably, global climate is lead by the oceanic expression of thermal energy which they have previously absorbed.  It that regard, the Pacific Ocean is the most influential.  The pacific decadal oscillation (including effects like El Nino and La Nina) is evident in global temperature records, steering them like a rudder according to 'warm' and 'cool' phases, wherein warmer and cooler currents shift to the surface.

The surface temperatures of the oceans are directly connected to their cloud cover, which in turn modulates the greenhouse effect and how much sunlight reaches the surface.  Our understanding of changes in cloud cover are untenably uncertain, past, present, future; and clouds remain the primary reason for the diversity of models and predictions.

So, there remains a significant possibility that the mystery of cloud cover conceals the sensitivity of our climate, representing a far more consequential future than what the average climatologist expects.  In conjunction with the beginning of the 'warm phase' of the PDO (\~2035), there is a significant possibility that we'll be coming to terms with an unexpectedly chaotic reaction soon.

The method can be used as a proxy for past climates and weather patterns.,"Study: [Radiokrypton unveils dual moisture sources of a deep desert aquifer](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/33/16222)

**Significance**

Paleoprecipitation records and subsurface water storage properties are essential data ingredients for accurate hydroclimate and water balance projections. Although both types of data could be extracted from groundwater, their application over long timescales had been limited by the lack of appropriate chronometers. We used a long-lived radiokrypton isotope and identified two distinct moisture source contributions to a deep desert aquifer from low eccentricity periods, one recent and the other 360 ky ago. The groundwater recharge periods show the sensitivity of the moisture transport processes to orbital forcing, whereas the long storage reflects subsurface flow attenuation exerted by faults. Krypton-81 enables groundwater to serve as a direct record of paleoprecipitation over land and of subsurface water storage for the past 1,300 ky.

**Abstract**

In arid regions, groundwater is a vital resource that can also provide a long-term record of the regional water cycle. However, the use of groundwater as a paleoclimate proxy has been limited by the complex hydrology and the lack of appropriate chronometers to determine the recharge time without complication. Applying  ⁸¹Kr, a long-lived radioisotope tracer, we investigate the paleohydroclimate and subsurface water storage properties of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer in the Negev Desert, Israel. Based on the spatial distributions of stable isotopes and the abundance of  ⁸¹Kr, we resolve subsurface mixing and identify two distinct moisture sources of the recharge: one recent (&lt;38 ky ago) from the Mediterranean and the other 361 ± 30 ky ago from the tropical Atlantic, both of which occurred under conditions of low orbital eccentricity comparable to that of the present. The recent recharge provided by the moisture from Mediterranean cyclones can be attributed to the southward shift of the storm track during the Last Glacial Maximum, and the earlier recharge can be attributed to moisture from the Atlantic delivered as tropical plumes under a climate colder than the present. Furthermore, the residence time of the latter reveals that tectonically active terrain can store groundwater for an unexpectedly long period, likely due to strongly attenuated groundwater flow across the fault zones. With this tracer, groundwater can now serve as a direct record of paleoprecipitation over land and of subsurface water storage from the mid-Pleistocene and onward.",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

Methane has been rising rapidly in the atmosphere over the past decade, contributing to global climate change. Unlike the late 20th century when the rise in atmospheric methane was accompanied by an enrichment in the heavier carbon stable isotope (13C) of methane, methane in recent years has become more depleted in ^(13)C. This depletion has been widely interpreted as indicating a primarily biogenic source for the increased methane. Here we show that part of the change may instead be associated with emissions from shale-gas and shale-oil development. Previous studies have not explicitly considered shale gas, even though most of the increase in natural gas production globally over the past decade is from shale gas. The methane in shale gas is somewhat depleted in ^(13)C relative to conventional natural gas. Correcting earlier analyses for this difference, we conclude that shale-gas production in North America over the past decade may have contributed more than half of all of the increased emissions from fossil fuels globally and approximately one-third of the total increased emissions from all sources globally over the past decade.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

We juxtapose 386 prominent contrarians with 386 expert scientists by tracking their digital footprints across ∼200,000 research publications and ∼100,000 English-language digital and print media articles on climate change. Projecting these individuals across the same backdrop facilitates quantifying disparities in media visibility and scientific authority, and identifying organization patterns within their association networks. Here we show via direct comparison that contrarians are featured in 49% more media articles than scientists. Yet when comparing visibility in mainstream media sources only, we observe just a 1% excess visibility, which objectively demonstrates the crowding out of professional mainstream sources by the proliferation of new media sources, many of which contribute to the production and consumption of climate change disinformation at scale. These results demonstrate why climate scientists should increasingly exert their authority in scientific and public discourse, and why professional journalists and editors should adjust the disproportionate attention given to contrarians.",Positive,Global stance

&gt;The CESM2 ECS is 5.3K, diagnosed with SOM simulations, an increase of over 1K from CESM1. Higher ECS in CESM2 compared to CESM1 appears to be a consequence of changes to cloud feedbacks and altering ACI to match the 20th century temperature record, which also impacted feedbacks.

&gt;  
&gt;362 is not that the CESM2 ECS is wrong (all models are wrong, Box \[1976\]), but that it might  
&gt;

Their project doesn't seem likely to slow down export much.  Given how wide Fram Strait it is, it would just mostly just push the ice to the east a bit.  If the effect was just that ice just held together longer, more freshwater would arrive at the downwelling zone, leading to a cooling effect instead.  If you wanted to slow down ice circulation Nares would be a better choice, since it's jammed with ice much of the time.

Also, the direct effect of a fresher Arctic ocean would be more ice and a cooling effect.

CESM2 seems to have the AMOC as a global cooling effect, with it being associated with fewer El Nino events, and less positive low level cloud feedback in the eastern tropical Pacific. Hence decreasing AMOC seems to be a positive feedback.

Their costs for the full application they simulate seem to be around $50B/year, taking their numbers and ignoring the ""last mile"" costs which ought to be the largest part of the cost.

It's not clear how effective the albedo reduction should be in general, given that the thin glass spheres should be buried in snow much of the time, ought to serve as a site for plant colonization, and may be crushed by ice which regularly crushes large steel ships.

Electrical/gas/oil etc: just add up the total global energy we consume each year and make the assumption that it all breaks down into waste heat released into the atmosphere as sensible heat (pretty reasonable), then:

5.67E20 \[Joules per year\] / (60\*60\*24\*365 \[seconds\]) = 1.8E13 Watts

Over the surface of the Earth (5.1E14 m2), that's: 0.035 W/m2

As for human metabolism: each person puts out about 150W. So with 7.5B people, that's: 150\*1.5E9 = 1.125E12 Watts

Then with global surface area 5.1E14 m2 thats: 0.0022 W/m2

So together, that's 0.0375 W/m2.

Compare that with the amount of radiative forcing from additional heat from anthropogenic greenhouse gasses, which is about 2.5 W/m2, then you see that the actual heat generated from human activities is pretty small when spread over the Earth (about 1.5% of energy compared with GHG warming). That's not to say it's insignificant, because the great majority of this energy gets released into cities, which make up about 2% of the Earths surface. So in a city, the extra output from us being there (energy use and metabolism) is equal (in order of magnitude) to global warming forcing! So that's pretty interesting!

**TLDR**: human caused heat globally is about 1.5% of energy compared with greenhouse gasses, but significant in cities.

Edit: oh, you were also comparing it to the energy from the sun? That is on average about 340 W/m2 (including night time and a spherical Earth), so human-caused heat is about 10,000 times less energy than the average received from the sun.",Positive,Undefined

&gt;&gt;A 2017 survey of  global catastrophic risks by the Global Challenges Foundation found that: “In high-end [climate] scenarios, the scale of  destruction is beyond our capacity to model, with a high likelihood of  human civilization coming to an end.”

The Global Challenges survey is being referenced in the context of [extreme heating of over 6 degrees C](https://globalchallenges.org/en/our-work/annual-report/annual-report-2017/catastrophic-climate-change). I'm not sure if this would be considered controversial among most climate scientists, but the World Bank for example has stated that it considers that 4C may be beyond the limit of adaptation.

Sure I give the odd talk to a lay audience but I think there are better communicators, perhaps those more focused on the teaching end of academia, who could do a much better job than I.

As this was posted previously [from Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-results-from-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-matter), I did some more reading on it.  


We -don't- know yet why it's higher, which is important. This [article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/new-climate-models-predict-warming-surge) (quotes are taken from it, Carbon Brief, &amp; OP's article) goes into more detail about the models, and the issues they've had with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; “is definitely real. There’s no question,” says Reto Knutti, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “Is that realistic or not? At this point, we don’t know.” 

 

&gt;The next step is for climate scientists to understand in detail why some of the new models are showing this shift in ECS – and how this fits with other lines of evidence. This includes looking at other measures of sensitivity, including “[transient climate response](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-scientists-estimate-climate-sensitivity)” (TCR), which measures the rate of warming.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The new simulations are only now being discussed at meetings, and not all the numbers are in, so “it’s a bit too early to get wound up,” says John Fyfe, a climate scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria, whose model is among those running much hotter than in the past. “But maybe we have to face a reality in the future that’s more pessimistic than it was in the past.” 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The results so far are “not sufficient to convince me,” says Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. In the effort to account for atmospheric components that are too small to directly simulate, like clouds, the new models could easily have strayed from reality, she says. “That’s always going to be a bumpy road.” 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Even so, the model results remain disconcerting, Gettelman says. The planet is already warming faster than humans can cope with, after all. “The scary part is these models might be right,” he says. “Because that would be pretty devastating.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The new data on aerosol emissions led to a stronger cooling effect in the NCAR model than previous versions. However, the stronger aerosol-related cooling also led to an unrealistic portrayal of 20th century climate. When the model was reconfigured in response, it produced a more accurate reproduction of 20th- and 21st-century climate, including cloud behavior—but with a higher ECS, which pointed to a more ominous portrayal of future change.

So it -may- be higher. More information and data is needed to properly assess this. Especially given the CESM2 models are included in [CMIP6](https://cmip6workshop19.sciencesconf.org/data/CMIP6_CMIP6AnalysisWorkshop_Barcelona_190325_FINAL.pdf).

&gt; The exact implications will only become clear once more analysis work is done using the latest generation climate models. In the meantime, the IPCC’s [special report on 1.5C](https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-ipccs-special-report-on-climate-change-at-one-point-five-c), published last year, remains the most up-to-date and robust assessment of the carbon budgets needed to meet the Paris goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“It does indeed look like many of the latest models will have ECS values higher than the IPCC ‘likely range’ of 1.5-4.5°C,” said Peter Cox (University of Exeter) in an email. “It seems that the new models with high ECS have more low-level cloud that tends to burn off under climate change, producing an amplifying feedback on warming.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Cox is lead author of a [2018 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25450) in *Nature* that examined temperature variability around long-term warming. The study concluded that the odds of ECS going outside the long-accepted range of 1.5-4.5°C were very small. “It is worth noting that observational constraints from both the temperature trend and temperature variability still suggest ECS of around 3°C,” said Cox. “So climate science has a conundrum to solve here.”",Positive,Global stance

CDR is amazing, but very difficult to scale, I am just praying that governments turn to it en masse in a few decades. That has a very low risk factor.

SRM is more ""revolutionary"" it often involves the injection of aerosols into the stratosphere, or in some cases, blocking out the sun. This has an enormous risk facto involved, a paper has just been published discussing how aerosols might not have as much of a cooling effect as previously though.

"Should I support this, yay or nay?",2019,8,Saw an ad about using geoengineeroing to cool the Earth.,"Is this in the context of solar radiation management (SRM) via aerosol injection? If so, nay. For several reasons.

Have you seen Chernobyl? Imagine the scene where Jarred Harris' character is explaining why the reactor exploded with the red and blue labels. In this case, the red is increased CO2 increasing heat, and the blue is the aerosols pumped into the air to counter this. Without reducing our use of fossil fuels, CO2 increases, so we have to increase aerosols to account for the increase in trapped solar radiation by reflecting more before it gets trapped. However, aerosols rain out, and need to be continually replenished to maintain the cooling effect. There are also suggestions that their cooling effect is not uniform, and in fact may be nonexistent in some places, and so whichever nation/state/organisation in control of them would probably face massive political pressure (like, climate wars levels of pressure).

If they ever stop injecting aerosols, the ""red labels"" are still there. So we get all the global mean warming that we otherwise would have had, in the space of time it takes for the aerosols to rain out. I.e. in less than a decade. This would be pretty catastrophic.

Add to this the fact that aerosol injection counters only the warming effect of CO2 and not other effects such as ocean acidification and air pollution, it's at best a very very short term band aid while we simultaneously undertake massive carbon capture and storage efforts or at least massive decarbonisation, in my opinion.

[Better call Hansen](http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/CO2Emissions/TimeBomb_wRCPs.pdf) and tell him he's a liar too.  Direct observation also supports us tracking closer to RCP 8.5.  The average CO2 increase per year at Mauna Loa over the last 5 years has been 2.6PPM (and the rate of increase is increasing but we'll just ignore that for now).  1PPM is 2.13 PgC.  Given that 60% is absorbed (IPCC AR5) that implies actual emissions are closer to 13.75 GtC/yr which, oops, puts us slightly *ahead* of RCP 8.5.    Of course the 60% figure is not without its controversy but we must keep in mind that if anything sinks are degrading so that percentage might well shrink.

&gt; So you are cherry picking one source that feeds you what you want.

Wow, I said I've watched everything of his, that's all.  I even read denialist sites just to see IF there's anything to them.  But I like KA because he speaks frankly and broadly.   I gather you disagree with him?  What exactly are *your* credentials?

&gt; None of these sources support your claims.

My claim that the oceans are dying?  Of course not.  That's far too sweeping an assertion for any scientist to make.  But, connecting all the dots (all coral reefs are slated to die, acidification continuing, heating, pollution, etc), I'll say that I think they are going to be effectively dead as far as we've known them.

edit: I had errantly put ""40% is absorbed"" which is the opposite.  IPCC states ""About 40% of these anthropogenic CO2 emissions have remained in the atmosphere (880 ± 35 GtCO2) since 1750"" .  Corrected to read ""60% is absorbed.""",Positive,Undefined

____

**Abstract**

Previous studies reconstructed twentieth-century global mean sea level (GMSL) from sparse tide-gauge records to understand whether the recent high rates obtained from satellite altimetry are part of a longer-term acceleration. However, these analyses used techniques that can only accurately capture either the trend or the variability in GMSL, but not both. Here we present an improved hybrid sea-level reconstruction during 1900–2015 that combines previous techniques at time scales where they perform best. We find a persistent acceleration in GMSL since the 1960s and demonstrate that this is largely (~76%) associated with sea-level changes in the Indo-Pacific and South Atlantic. We show that the initiation of the acceleration in the 1960s is tightly linked to an intensification and a basin-scale equatorward shift of Southern Hemispheric westerlies, leading to increased ocean heat uptake, and hence greater rates of GMSL rise, through changes in the circulation of the Southern Ocean.",Positive,Global stance

Not exclusively.  I was talking about the health of the oceans and their likelihood of survival in a form usable to humans (of which around 3 billion depend on oceans for their primary source of protein).   We know the coral reefs aren't going to survive in a 2C scenario which I consider to be the bottom end of projections.  We also know that acidification can enter a feedback loop which will likely kill off much of what remains.

Primarily because of the abundance of food resulting from chemical fertilisers and mechanised (ie..fossil fueled) farming. The current population is already unsustainable if we continue to consume resources at the same rate. So.. add climate pressure reducing the amount of cultivated land, plus mass migration, plus increasing scarcity of resources such as water and energy.. and something will have to give. Based on what was historically possible with pre industrial farming at least 60% of the population will starve if global farming collapses. If there are  enclaves with sufficient technology and a mild enough climate to produce enough food and keep civilisation running.. they will have to keep everyone they can't feed out or face collapse too.

We have good evidence that societies in general are vulnerable to the kinds of major economic, physical and social shocks that would be the direct consequences of such levels of warming (breakdowns in law and order, major failings in communications, electricity, transport and financial infrastructure, etc.). It is this vulnerability that lead many to reason that if you knocked out enough of these foundations 'civilization' would collapse, as governments and institutions of education, health and culture would fall by the wayside as we prioritized more immediate survival. Alternatively, the shocks would cause us to lay blame on our neighbours and global warfare would be the major driving force of our downfall.

But on the other hand, no-one knows how our current societies could adapt to these challenges, because we've never faced them before in the same way, and human society is fundamentally different to the last time we faced major physical catastrophe (like the last Ice Age) - and arguably even significantly different to the last time we grappled with man-made catastrophes (like the World Wars).

Predicting peoples' reactions to things at this level remains beyond the realm of science, so by definition most of the media coverage ends up being speculation.

A lot of the science doesn't state directly that 'humans will go extinct' or 'civilization will collapse' (if *any* that are reliable), and a lot of the research/papers that occur don't test for these ranges, and much of the impact studies relate to two degrees in particular: 1.5C and 4C.

You won't really find any scientists worth their salt saying these will happen either, as there are a great many factors that go into these, though I would imagine most would agree these scenarios are more likely the higher in temp. increase we go.

**Plain Language Summary**

The Pliocene Epoch is the most recent time in Earth history when CO2 levels exceeded 400 ppm. The climate was warmer than preindustrial times, with smaller ice sheets. Previous studies suggested that the Pacific ocean was stuck in a “permanent El Niño"" during the Pliocene. However, climate model simulations do not predict that this would happen at CO2 levels near 400 ppm ‐ unusual changes in climate, such as large changes in cloud cover or hurricane frequency, would be needed to explain it. In this work we reanalyze Pliocene SST data and do not find evidence of a “permanent El Niño.” Our results suggest that difference in temperatures across the tropical Pacific was smaller than it is today, but only by about 1°C. Climate model simulations agree with our new analysis, suggesting that higher CO2, along with small changes in ice, vegetation, and mountains, are enough to explain Pliocene climate. We also show that the SST patterns in the Pliocene Pacific Ocean look similar to those that climate models predict under a low‐emissions climate change scenario. The similarity suggests that the Pliocene can help us understand how the tropics respond to an ongoing increase in CO2.

**Abstract**

With CO2 concentrations similar to today (410 ppm), the Pliocene Epoch offers insights into climate changes under a moderately warmer world. Previous work suggested a low zonal sea‐surface temperature (SST) gradient in the tropical Pacific during the Pliocene, the so‐called “permanent El Niño."" Here, we re‐calculate SSTs using the alkenone proxy and find moderate reductions in the both zonal and meridional SST gradients during the mid‐Piacenzian warm period (MPWP). These reductions are captured by coupled climate model simulations of the Pliocene, especially those that simulate weaker Walker circulation. We also produce a spatial reconstruction of MPWP Pacific SSTs that closely resembles both Pliocene and future, low‐emissions simulations; a pattern that is to a first order, diagnostic of weaker Walker circulation. Therefore, Pliocene warmth does not require drastic changes in the climate system ‐ rather, it supports the expectation that the Walker circulation will weaken in the future under higher CO2",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

This study presents a simulated simultaneous retrieval of mass mean cloud ice particle effective diameter, ice water content, water vapor, and temperature profiles using a combination of a 94‐GHz cloud radar and multifrequency (118, 183, 240, 310, 380, 664, and 850 GHz) millimeter‐ and submillimeter‐wave radiometers from a space platform. The retrieval capabilities and uncertainties of the combined radar and microwave radiometers are quantified. We show that this combined active and passive remote sensing approach with SmallSat technologies addresses a gap in the current state‐of‐the‐art remote sensing measurements of ice cloud properties, especially deriving vertical profiles of ice cloud particle sizes in the atmosphere together with the ambient thermodynamic conditions. Therefore, this new approach can serve as a plausible candidate for future missions that target cloud and precipitation processes to improve weather forecasts and climate predictions.",Negative,Undefined

We combine econometrically estimated responses of energy use to income, hot and cold days with future projections of spatial population and national income under five socioeconomic scenarios and temperature increases around 2050 for two emission scenarios simulated by 21 Earth System Models (ESMs). Here we show that, across 210 realizations of socioeconomic and climate scenarios, vigorous (moderate) warming increases global climate-exposed energy demand before adaptation around 2050 by 25–58% (11–27%), on top of a factor 1.7–2.8 increase above present-day due to socioeconomic developments. We find broad agreement among ESMs that energy demand rises by more than 25% in the tropics and southern regions of the USA, Europe and China. Socioeconomic scenarios vary widely in the number of people in low-income countries exposed to increases in energy demand.",Negative,Global stance

ERFaci can be considered as the residual between ERFand ERFari ∼ −2.19 W m−2, which is close to the anthropogenicaerosol indirect effects (AIE) in Wang et al.(2014) and the simulated AIE by CAM5 (Ghan et al.,2012), but **much larger than the values given by IPCC**(2013) \[−0.45 (−1.2, 0) W m−2\]. Hoose et al. (2009)found that the AIE was very sensitive to the lower boundof cloud droplet number concentration (CDNCmin), andthe absolute value of AIE decreased rapidly when theCDNCmin increased from 0 to 40 cm−3. Many modelshave adopted different CDNCmin, but **CDNCmin was setat 0 in this study**, as the prescription of CDNCmin is stillphysically unclear (Hoose et al., 2009). **This is the mainreason for the much larger simulated ERFaci**.

In short, they've made the indirect effect of aerosols as large as the model they are using can make it. Maybe a new upper bound? Or maybe something that's worth discarding?

Abstract:  Limiting global warming to 1.5 or 2.0°C requires strong mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Concurrently, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will decline, due to coemission with GHG, and measures to improve air quality. However, the combined climate effect of GHG and aerosol emissions over the industrial era is poorly constrained. Here we show the climate impacts from removing present‐day anthropogenic aerosol emissions and compare them to the impacts from moderate GHG‐dominated global warming. Removing aerosols induces a global mean surface heating of 0.5–1.1°C, and precipitation increase of 2.0–4.6%. Extreme weather indices also increase. We find a higher sensitivity of extreme events to aerosol reductions, per degree of surface warming, in particular over the major aerosol emission regions. Under near‐term warming, we find that regional climate change will depend strongly on the balance between aerosol and GHG forcing.",Positive,Global stance

,2019,7,"Over the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, the cumulative CO2‐radiative forcing exceeds the amount of energy released upon combustion by a factor &gt;100,000","For reference, this means...

1kWh = 3.6MJ (requiring more than 3.6MJ of energy from combustion of carbon due to conversion efficiency being less than 100%)

According to the paper above, burning 3.6MJ carbon results in the retention of an additional 360 GJ (100 000* 3.6MJ) from cumulative radiative forcing on the Earth system.

 1 ton TNT = 4.184 GJ, so...  that comes to &gt;86 tons TNT / kWh.

The average American home uses 867 kWh / month. 

If that electricity is produced from burning coal, the CO2 released will, over it's long lifetime, eventually result in a cumulative radiative forcing of about 867 kWh * 86 tons TNT / kWh = 74 kilotons of TNT, or 5 times the energy of the Hiroshima bombing.

Most of that energy has not yet been absorbed by the Earth. The authors of the paper above calculate that the cumulative radiative forcing of the Earth from human fossil fuel burning is currently only about 60 times the energy of combustion of those fuels.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions
,2019,7,Research Highlight: Loss of Arctic's Reflective Sea Ice Will Advance Global Warming by 25 Year,"There are several issues with this study. First, they assume constant cloudiness. Another paper found that there is much more cloud over the melted ice. The source they use to base their constant cloudiness on only showed that there is constant cloudiness at the height of summer but the minimum sea ice extent is in september.

Two studies also published in 2019 find that there is an increase in cloudiness over the melted ice. The [clouds contributed 2-3 times the albedo effect of the ice / se](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/10/1/12/htm)a. When the ice melts then the [clouds cover an average of 81%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44155-w) over the period where the albedo effect operates.

Also with the narrow focus on the Arctic they are not taking a global picture.

As an [academic response](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/21/E2157) to their [2014 earlier pape](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/9/3322.abstract)r said, averaged over the whole world the changing climate from 2000 to 2012 has lead to a reduction in the global flux by 0.14 watts per square meter rather than an increase. Most of that reduction is in the southern hemisphere (reduction of 0.26 watts per square meter compared to a 0.03 watts per square meter in the northern hemisphere).

This is the map shared in that letter. It shows the change in total  solar energy input from 2000 to 2012 where red means it got hotter,  blue cooler, yellow is a slight reduction. As you'll see the Arctic is red or orange showing a clear increase but many other areas of the world are green or blue showing a strong decrease in watts per square meter.

[https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dcc04192c82fbcf68f46a854194e4b50](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dcc04192c82fbcf68f46a854194e4b50)

 So their estimates for the Arctic for the future are over estimates and their assumption that the Arctic albedo change will warm the entire world is based on blinkered thinking not looking at the rest of the world. 

 The IPCC report in 2018 found that there are no tipping points from Actic ice melt (see[ 3.6.3.1 Sea Ice](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/)). As soon as we reach zero emissions the Arctic ice then is in steady state and will slowly being to heal as some of the excess CO2 leaves the atmosphere.

We will get another overview in 2021, [IPCC Working Group II starts preparing their contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/2019/01/15/ipcc-wgiiar6-lam1/) but I think it is safe to say they will not be making any changes in their projections as a result of this paper.

**Abstract**

During the first half of the nineteenth century, several large tropical volcanic eruptions occurred within less than three decades. The global climate effects of the 1815 Tambora eruption have been investigated, but those of an eruption in 1808 or 1809 whose source is unknown and the eruptions in the 1820s and 1830s have received less attention. Here we analyse the effect of the sequence of eruptions in observations, global three-dimensional climate field reconstructions and coupled climate model simulations. All the eruptions were followed by substantial drops of summer temperature over the Northern Hemisphere land areas. In addition to the direct radiative effect, which lasts 2–3 years, the simulated ocean–atmosphere heat exchange sustained cooling for several years after these eruptions, which affected the slow components of the climate system. Africa was hit by two decades of drought, global monsoons weakened and the tracks of low-pressure systems over the North Atlantic moved south. The low temperatures and increased precipitation in Europe triggered the last phase of the advance of Alpine glaciers. Only after the 1850s did the transition into the period of anthropogenic warming start. We conclude that the end of the Little Ice Age was marked by the recovery from a sequence of volcanic eruptions, which makes it difficult to define a single pre-industrial baseline.",Negative,Global stance

&gt;With partial-year sea ice loss, this is likely to not be a massive jump up to this, and its highly unlikely this would be a jump at all (all sea ice would have to vanish all at once for this!), but more a gradual shift into this as the sea ice diminishes, especially as it approaches being year-round ice free.

### ABSTRACT

The effective radiative forcing (ERF), as newly defined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5), of three anthropogenic aerosols \[sulphate (SF), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC)\] and their comprehensive climatic effects were simulated and discussed, using the updated aerosol‐climate online model of BCC\_AGCM2.0.1\_CUACE/Aero. From 1850 to 2010, the total ERF of these anthropogenic aerosols was −2.49 W m−2, of which the aerosol–radiation interactive ERF (ERFari) and aerosol–cloud interactive ERF (ERFaci) were ∼ −0.30 and −2.19 W m−2, respectively. SF was the largest contributor to the total ERF, with an ERF of −2.37 W m−2. The ERF of BC and OC were 0.12 and −0.31 W m−2, respectively. From 1850 to 2010, anthropogenic aerosols brought about a decrease of ∼2.53 K and ∼0.20 mm day−1 in global annual mean surface temperature and precipitation, respectively. Surface cooling was most obvious over mid‐ and high latitudes in the northern hemisphere (NH). Precipitation change was most pronounced near the equator, with decreased and increased rainfall to the north and south of the equator, respectively; this might be largely related to the enhanced Hadley Cell in the NH. Relative humidity near surface was increased, especially over land, due to surface cooling induced by anthropogenic aerosols. Cloud cover and water path were increased, especially in or near the source regions of anthropogenic aerosols. Experiments based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 given in IPCC AR5 shows the dramatic decrease in three anthropogenic aerosols in 2100 will lead to an increase of ∼2.06 K and 0.16 mm day−1 in global annual mean surface temperature and precipitation, respectively, compared with those in 2010.",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

The online video-sharing website YouTube is extremely popular globally, also as a tool for information on science and environmental topics. However, only little is known about what kind of information users find when they are searching for information about climate science, climate change, and climate engineering on YouTube. This contribution presents results from an exploratory research project that investigates whether videos found on YouTube adhere to or challenge scientific consensus views. Ten search terms were employed to search for and analyze 200 videos about climate and climate modification topics, which are contested topics in online media. The online anonymization tool Tor has been used for the randomization of the sample and to avoid personalization of the results. A heuristic qualitative classification tool was set up to categorize the videos in the sample. Eighty-nine videos of the 200 videos in the sample are supporting scientific consensus views about anthropogenic climate change, and climate scientists are discussing climate topics with deniers of climate change in four videos in the sample. Unexpectedly, the majority of the videos in the sample (107 videos) supports worldviews that are opposing scientific consensus views: 16 videos deny anthropogenic climate change and 91 videos in the sample propagate straightforward conspiracy theories about climate engineering and climate change. Videos supporting the scientific mainstream view received only slightly more views (16,941,949 views in total) than those opposing the mainstream scientific position (16,939,655 views in total). Consequences for the public communication of climate change and climate engineering are discussed in the second part of the article. The research presented in this contribution is particularly interested in finding out more about strategically distorted communications about climate change and climate engineering in online environments and in critically analyzing them.",Positive,Global stance

**Underwater melting**

How fast does warm ocean water melt glaciers that terminate in the sea? That question is central to understanding how fast ice sheets may lose mass, and thus how fast sea level will rise, in response to global warming, but there are few data about the process. Sutherland et al. used repeat multibeam sonar surveys to observe an Alaskan subsurface tidewater glacier face to create a time series of its melting and calving patterns. They observed melt rates up to a hundred times larger than those predicted by theory, observations that compel us to reevaluate predictions of such ice loss.

**Abstract**

Ice loss from the world’s glaciers and ice sheets contributes to sea level rise, influences ocean circulation, and affects ecosystem productivity. Ongoing changes in glaciers and ice sheets are driven by submarine melting and iceberg calving from tidewater glacier margins. However, predictions of glacier change largely rest on unconstrained theory for submarine melting. Here, we use repeat multibeam sonar surveys to image a subsurface tidewater glacier face and document a time-variable, three-dimensional geometry linked to melting and calving patterns. Submarine melt rates are high across the entire ice face over both seasons surveyed and increase from spring to summer. The observed melt rates are up to two orders of magnitude greater than predicted by theory, challenging current simulations of ice loss from tidewater glaciers.",Positive,Undefined

"Does anyone know how to make an apples to apples comparison of ""how far along"" we are in terms of the RCPs? Is the current GHG concentration ""ahead"" or ""behind"" schedule compared to say RCP8.5, and by how much?

The reason I ask is that I'm a climate scientist specializing in local impacts for adaptation and risk assessment, and the folks who use our projections are increasingly asking about where RCP8.5 fits in terms of emissions reduction strategies and where we are at so far. I've generally viewed this question as a red herring but it's just coming up too much to not answer any more.

If you look at the values in Table 2 of [https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html) for Total Radiative Forcing they are larger than the historical numbers at [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare) by about 50% in 1980.

Of course these aren't directly comparable as the NOAA paper is just converting concentrations with constants and ignoring feedbacks. So I suspect the main difference is water vapour feedback perhaps? The RCP database notes that total concentration exludes mineral dust and the effect of land albedo, however.

The difference between the two measures of total radiative forcing decreases with time and if you extrapolate from the 4 points of overlap it would be about 32% today. Applying this ratio seems to suggest that we are doing (a little bit) better in 2018 than RCP8.5 forcing by 2020 was projected to be. Does this sound about right?

**Abstract**

Multidecadal surface temperature changes may be forced by natural as well as anthropogenic factors, or arise unforced from the climate system. Distinguishing these factors is essential for estimating sensitivity to multiple climatic forcings and the amplitude of the unforced variability. Here we present 2,000-year-long global mean temperature reconstructions using seven different statistical methods that draw from a global collection of temperature-sensitive palaeoclimate records. Our reconstructions display synchronous multidecadal temperature fluctuations that are coherent with one another and with fully forced millennial model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 across the Common Era. A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300–1800 ce) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multidecadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

Earth’s climate history is often understood by breaking it down into constituent climatic epochs1. Over the Common Era (the past 2,000 years) these epochs, such as the Little Ice Age, have been characterized as having occurred at the same time across extensive spatial scales5. Although the rapid global warming seen in observations over the past 150 years does show nearly global coherence6, the spatiotemporal coherence of climate epochs earlier in the Common Era has yet to be robustly tested. Here we use global palaeoclimate reconstructions for the past 2,000 years, and find no evidence for preindustrial globally coherent cold and warm epochs. In particular, we find that the coldest epoch of the last millennium—the putative Little Ice Age—is most likely to have experienced the coldest temperatures during the fifteenth century in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, during the seventeenth century in northwestern Europe and southeastern North America, and during the mid-nineteenth century over most of the remaining regions. Furthermore, the spatial coherence that does exist over the preindustrial Common Era is consistent with the spatial coherence of stochastic climatic variability. This lack of spatiotemporal coherence indicates that preindustrial forcing was not sufficient to produce globally synchronous extreme temperatures at multidecadal and centennial timescales. By contrast, we find that the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the twentieth century for more than 98 per cent of the globe. This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures, but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years.",Positive,Global stance

The reason I bring this up is because just because Methane is a potent gas on Earth today doesn’t mean it always will be (it will become weaker relative to CO2 over time as it’s concentration increases), that it always has been (Earth’s atmosphere looked very different billions of years ago), or that it is just as potent on other planetary bodies (e.g. Titan, which has *a lot* of methane in its atmosphere).",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

The problem is not in communicating the science. The scientific evidence has been clear for decades. People don't avoid taking action on climate because they don't have the facts. They don't take action because it conflicts with their world view, and/or their ability to make a profit (or for their mates to make a profit).

XR doesn't have a problem with communicating the science, it does fine. Climate activists rarely communicate the science perfectly, but they generally get it close enough. Mistakes are usually minor, but *anything* slightly wrong will be picked up by the capitalist media, because they aren't interested in the truth, they're just interested in discrediting the climate action narrative.

I don't really know what can be done about it, other than keeping on keeping on. The climate movement has a massive task ahead of it, and the neo-liberal media-industry complex has massive inertia, but it will happen eventually, the only question is how much we're going to fuck things up before we overhaul our global system. Nicholas Klein's quote is worth remembering: ""First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.""

**Abstract**

Ship tracks appear as long winding linear features in satellite images and are produced by aerosols from ship exhausts changing low cloud properties. They are one of the best examples of aerosol‐cloud interaction experiments. However, manually finding ship tracks from satellite data on a large scale is prohibitively costly while a large number of samples are required to improve our understanding. Here we train a deep neural network to automate finding ship tracks. The neural network model generalizes well as it not only finds ship tracks labeled by human experts but also detects those that are occasionally missed by humans. It finds more ship tracks than all previous studies combined and produces a map of ship track distributions off the California coast that matches well with known shipping traffic. Our technique will enable studying aerosol effects on low clouds using ship tracks on a large scale, which will potentially narrow the uncertainty of the aerosol‐cloud interactions.",Positive,Undefined

,2019,7,"I was curious about Methane in the atmosphere, and how I was told it's often overlooked, but garners more powerful effects than Carbon when released in the atmosphere?","Methane is somewhere between 150x-120x more potent than CO2 when initially released, however I recently found this quick excerpt from scientist Gavin Schmidt from the blog Realclimate:  GWP on very short periods is not a useful thing to calculate because the climate system integrates GHG forcings over decades. Even 20 years is a bit of stretch. 50 or 100 year periods are the most relevant for what will actually happen. – gavin 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a layman, so this may be wrong but: While methane does contribute quite a bit to radiative forcing, it often degrades before the full effect of that can be felt on the climate system. In other words, the system isn't in equilibrium while methane enters the system.  [https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/causes-of-climate-change/0/steps/13583](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/causes-of-climate-change/0/steps/13583) 

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, even if there were some abrupt ""pulse"" of methane or whichever, it most likely would never even be fully integrated into the climate due to degradation and lag. However, methane degrades into CO2 so it does add to the long-tail of risks. 

&amp;#x200B;

In comparison to CO2, methane has a pretty short lifetime. The lifetime of methane is around 12.4 years, while CO2 lasts 20-200 years. However, to remove the last of that carbon dioxide it can take several hundred thousand years.

&gt;All the policies we have to tackle climate change are based on this paradigm of thinking-- they all rely on that decoupling. When we look at the COPS, the climate change conferences, the very purpose is officially to decarbonize societies. They're based on unofficial text called United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in this UNFCCC article 3 paragraph 5 is written the imperative for economic growth... Economic growth to finance investments in technologies that  will enable us to achieve this decoupling. This decoupling has never happened and there's no sensible reason to assert that it ever will.

A good starting point would be [in this list here.](https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/lists/scientists-who-do-climate?s=09), as they cover a lot of specialties and definitely address the XR, but also answer questions.

Another would be the models themselves- research CIMP5/CIMP6 as they're important for climate sensitivity, though you already know this given you post them a lot.

I had Peter Kalmus [suggest this source](https://nca2014.globalchange.gov) as well to me recently.

Avoid Wadhams and Beckwith, McPhereson as well. Make sure you emphasize on how global dimming works (I made a giant post about this on /u/ClimateNurse, it's rudimentary though, so it's not 100% accurate but it's a good place to get an idea of how it works.) I also covered the methane bomb/hydrates there.

Katharine Hayhoe has a massive YouTube channel backed by PBS called Global Weirding', and she tackles a lot of claims and ideas involving climate change.

www.skepticalscience.com is great, as is www.climatefeedback.org, as they address David Wallace-Wells 'The Uninhabitable Earth' and the recent think-tank report from Australia predicting the fall of civilization from 2050+. 

Carbon Brief has AMAZING work. Check them out and their data list on the damages from 1.5 to 2c, as it sometimes goes out to 4C.

...And claims by Peter Wadhams from as early as 2016.

Glen Peters also covers a lot on his Twitter. Avoid Ben See if you go on there though, he's overwhelmingly alarmist and uses Beckwith/Wadhams excessively, uses out of date media, an d predicts 4C by 2050.

Other claims: 

The ocean warming faster than expected (40%) is unfounded and used in the XR. The actual warming from it is roughly 25% on average (5% to 60%), and is in line with CIMP5 models and has little effect on CO2 budgets. Carbon Brief covers this.

**Abstract**

Climate-related risks are dependent not only on the warming trend from GHGs, but also on the variability about the trend. However, assessment of the impacts of climate change tends to focus on the ultimate level of global warming, only occasionally on the rate of global warming, and rarely on variability about the trend. Here we show that models that are more sensitive to GHGs emissions (that is, higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)) also have higher temperature variability on timescales of several years to several decades. Counter-intuitively, high-sensitivity climates, as well as having a higher chance of rapid decadal warming, are also more likely to have had historical ‘hiatus’ periods than lower-sensitivity climates. Cooling or hiatus decades over the historical period, which have been relatively uncommon, are more than twice as likely in a high-ECS world (ECS = 4.5 K) compared with a low-ECS world (ECS = 1.5 K). As ECS also affects the background warming rate under future scenarios with unmitigated anthropogenic forcing, the probability of a hyper-warming decade—over ten times the mean rate of global warming for the twentieth century—is even more sensitive to ECS.

**Abstract**

The feasibility of large-scale biological CO2 removal to achieve stringent climate targets remains unclear. Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) offers an alternative negative emissions technology (NET) option. Here we conduct the first inter-model comparison on the role of DACCS in 1.5 and 2 °C scenarios, under a variety of techno-economic assumptions. Deploying DACCS significantly reduces mitigation costs, and it complements rather than substitutes other NETs. The key factor limiting DACCS deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios’ average DACCS scale-up rates of 1.5 GtCO2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300 EJ/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that DACCS can be deployed at scale, and finding it to be subsequently unavailable, leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8 °C. DACCS should therefore be developed and deployed alongside, rather than instead of, other mitigation options.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions
"Does anyone know how to make an apples to apples comparison of ""how far along"" we are in terms of the RCPs? Is the current GHG concentration ""ahead"" or ""behind"" schedule compared to say RCP8.5, and by how much?

The reason I ask is that I'm a climate scientist specializing in local impacts for adaptation and risk assessment, and the folks who use our projections are increasingly asking about where RCP8.5 fits in terms of emissions reduction strategies and where we are at so far. I've generally viewed this question as a red herring but it's just coming up too much to not answer any more.

If you look at the values in Table 2 of [https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html) for Total Radiative Forcing they are larger than the historical numbers at [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare) by about 50% in 1980.

Of course these aren't directly comparable as the NOAA paper is just converting concentrations with constants and ignoring feedbacks. So I suspect the main difference is water vapour feedback perhaps? The RCP database notes that total concentration exludes mineral dust and the effect of land albedo, however.

The difference between the two measures of total radiative forcing decreases with time and if you extrapolate from the 4 points of overlap it would be about 32% today. Applying this ratio seems to suggest that we are doing (a little bit) better in 2018 than RCP8.5 forcing by 2020 was projected to be. Does this sound about right? I had it in my head that we'd been emitting worse than RCP8.5 for quite some time now but maybe that was a few years ago and we've actually started turning away from this pathway a bit?

edit: typos",2019,7,Comparing current GHG concentrations / forcing to RCPs,"Ok so I've actually been fiddling around quite a bit with the NOAA and RPC database this last month so I think I can give a partial answer.

The NOAA does not take into account the (overall negative) forcing due to aerosols. They state they do this because of the remaining big uncertainty on those forcings.

That being said if you look at the RPC database's CO2e concentrations for ""GHGs only"", you will notice that they are also lower than the NOAA's. This is because the denomination ""GHGs only"" in the RPC database does not include all GHGs, but only those in the Kyoto perimeter, whereas the NOAA includes most common GHGs.

Moreover as you say the NOAA does not take into account feedback loops, but I don't know to which extend the RPC database does (that's up to each RPC).

As for your last question, I can give a partial answer by those two graphs https://imgur.com/1D3JAQI https://imgur.com/sWM1F5q. Those show the CO2e and AGGI from the RPC by taking into account only the GHG (but not only the Kyoto perimeter ones, i.e. I do as NOAA does) compared to 2018 values. In a way what I did was put the RPC Database and NOAA data on the same baseline / methods.

According to those graphs, the GHG emissions interpreted as immediate forcings^1 show two things. First, we are slightly below RPC8.5 but very close. Second, we're still near the beginning of the RPC's predictions so all four RPCs are quite close, therefore it would be hasty to say that ""we are clearly on RPC8.5 track"" from this alone.

One month of wildfires isn't the end of the world. If fires of comparable size become a trend month after month, that would be very worrying. There's no real human capacity to control wildfires across the largely uninhabited Arctic, and the nature of peat fires makes them especially hard to extinguish. There's also a lot of stuff to burn; roughly twice as much carbon in the permafrost than currently in the atmosphere. The garbage they throw in the air also darkens ice and snow across the Arctic, so it absorbs solar radiation more effectively and melts more quickly.

&amp;gt;I hadn’t seen this paper yet (been on holidays). – it’s nicely done and the point of accounting for processes like compaction is sound.

&amp;gt;What’s interesting is how most of lost carbon ends up laterally transported by water rather than emitted directly as CO2 to the atmosphere. The implication is that previous experiments observing permafrost CO2 emissions got that about right, but missed even more carbon being seeped away by water under the surface, either in dissolved or particle form. How this then affects total CO2 emissions gets complicated though – it depends on what happens to that dissolved /particulate carbon once it gets flushed out into rivers and the sea, where it can be buried and lost or respired and slightly enrich the seawater carbon stock (which might in turn affect CO2 drawdown in the ocean). As they put it, “the fate of the transported C is highly uncertain”. The caveat to all this though, as ever with experimental/observational studies, is how much this can be extrapolated across all the permafrost region, as soil types and dynamics can widely vary and this process may happen in some soil types more than others.

&amp;gt;Overall I think the main takeaway is that more permafrost C might well be lost than I summarise in this article, but that this extra C probably won’t be directly emitted as CO2 (it may end up emitted some point later depending on seawater chemistry, or buried at sea – it’s hard to say). This paper also backs up the point about how very little of permafrost C ends up as methane during degradation, with them finding it almost negligible in this experiment.

Having read the paper myself too, it neglects (unlike other websites) on how their study discovered how the soil carbon is absorbed into pools and other sorts of water and dissolved into it. We knew soil carbon was released before into the atmosphere, but not into water through this method (which may release later on).

____

**Summary**

**Background**

Increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) affect global nutrition via effects on agricultural productivity and nutrient content of food crops. We combined these effects with economic projections to estimate net changes in nutrient availability between 2010 and 2050.

**Methods**

In this modelling study, we used the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade to project per capita availability of protein, iron, and zinc in 2050. We used estimated changes in productivity of individual agricultural commodities to model effects on production, trade, prices, and consumption under moderate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Two independent sources of data, which used different methodologies to determine the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on different key crops, were combined with the modelled food supply results to estimate future nutrient availability.

**Findings**

Although technological change, market responses, and the effects of CO2 fertilisation on yield are projected to increase global availability of dietary protein, iron, and zinc, these increases are moderated by negative effects of climate change affecting productivity and carbon penalties on nutrient content. The carbon nutrient penalty results in decreases in the global availability of dietary protein of 4·1%, iron of 2·8%, and zinc of 2·5% as calculated using one dataset, and decreases in global availability of dietary protein of 2·9%, iron of 3·9%, and zinc of 3·4% using the other dataset. The combined effects of projected increases in atmospheric CO2 (ie, carbon nutrient penalty, CO2 fertilisation, and climate effects on productivity) will decrease growth in the global availability of nutrients by 19·5% for protein, 14·4% for iron, and 14·6% for zinc relative to expected technology and market gains by 2050. The many countries that currently have high levels of nutrient deficiency would continue to be disproportionately affected.

**Interpretation**

This approach is an improvement in estimating future global food security by simultaneously projecting climate change effects on crop productivity and changes in nutrient content under increased concentrations of CO2, which accounts for a much larger effect on nutrient availability than CO2 fertilisation. Regardless of the scenario used to project future consumption patterns, the net effect of increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will slow progress in decreasing global nutrient deficiencies.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Research reported during the past decade has shown that global warming is roughly proportional to the total amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This makes it possible to estimate the remaining carbon budget: the total amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide that can still be emitted into the atmosphere while holding the global average temperature increase to the limit set by the Paris Agreement. However, a wide range of estimates for the remaining carbon budget has been reported, reducing the effectiveness of the remaining carbon budget as a means of setting emission reduction targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement. Here we present a framework that enables us to track estimates of the remaining carbon budget and to understand how these estimates can improve over time as scientific knowledge advances. We propose that application of this framework may help to reconcile differences between estimates of the remaining carbon budget and may provide a basis for reducing uncertainty in the range of future estimates.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Abstract**

Existing estimates of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) indicate that, during the early twentieth century, the North Atlantic and northeast Pacific oceans warmed by twice the global average, whereas the northwest Pacific Ocean cooled by an amount equal to the global average. Such a heterogeneous pattern suggests first-order contributions from regional variations in forcing or in ocean–atmosphere heat fluxes. These older SST estimates are, however, derived from measurements of water temperatures in ship-board buckets, and must be corrected for substantial biases. Here we show that correcting for offsets among groups of bucket measurements leads to SST variations that correlate better with nearby land temperatures and are more homogeneous in their pattern of warming. Offsets are identified by systematically comparing nearby SST observations among different groups. Correcting for offsets in German measurements decreases warming rates in the North Atlantic, whereas correcting for Japanese measurement offsets leads to increased and more uniform warming in the North Pacific. Japanese measurement offsets in the 1930s primarily result from records having been truncated to whole degrees Celsius when the records were digitized in the 1960s. These findings underscore the fact that historical SST records reflect both physical and social dimensions in data collection, and suggest that further opportunities exist for improving the accuracy of historical SST records.",Positive,Undefined

Burned more than 1.2 million acres and in past 10 days alone and released more carbon emissions than Sweden’s total annual levels.,"That doesn't mean you get to completely disregard sources in these discussions. If you read through my comment history you'd see that I (probably) agree with you. Doesn't mean that you get to avoid providing sources or statements to support your opinion, however. This subreddit is focused on the science-side of things when it comes to climate change, so sources are rightly expected when engaging.

&amp;#x200B;

Your question is much too wide for anyone to give it any real answer or thought. There's a lot of thinkers who are involved in discussions about collapse, and the general opinion comes down to: ""We don't know when it will be or how it will happen, but we can assume based on trends."" And not all of those thinkers even have the same idea or opinion about how a collapse will look or be, it is an entire subject of it's own that precedes even climatology. Frankly, it might happen. It might not happen. It's a rather divise topic.

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't want to leave  a question like this unanswered from my perspective either, so I'll say this: I personally largely believe that collapse is a moral choice we can still make as a civilisation. Am I optimistic based on current trends? Far from it. But that's why I push for action, I want to be proven wrong and thus I push to prolong this civilisation in an assistance to make it transition. I don't think anyone can say it's too late, at least not yet. I also tend to lean more towards collapse being a slower process. The system of our civilisation is extremely advanced, so I believe it may very well cannibalize itself to stay afloat longer. We'll see large swaths of people die and civil strife before a collapse occurs, sadly. People tend to forget that there are events leading to a collapse, and those are usually full of suffering in their own right. When do I think it'll happen, if it does? I don't know. Maybe 2030. Maybe 2040. Maybe any decade in the future, maybe even centuries ahead.

&gt;This paper investigates the causation for the decline of the Atlantic  Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) from approximately 17 Sv to  about 9 Sv, when the atmospheric resolution of the Max Planck  Institute‐Earth System Model is enhanced from ∼1° to ∼0.5°. The results  show that the slowdown of the AMOC is caused by the cessation of deep  convection. In most modeling studies, this is thought to be controlled  by buoyancy fluxes in the convective regions, for example, by surface  freshwater flux that is introduced locally or via enormous input from  glacier or iceberg melts. While we find that freshwater is still the key  to the reduction of AMOC seen in the higher‐resolution run, the  freshening of the North Atlantic does not need to be directly caused by  local freshwater fluxes. Instead, it can be caused indirectly through  winds via a reduced wind‐driven gyre circulation and salinity transport  associated to this circulation, as seen in the higher‐resolution run.

**Abstract**

Satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations are routinely applied toward the estimation of dynamic oblateness, C₂₀, which is the largest globally integrated component of Earth's time‐variable gravity field. Since 2002, GRACE and GRACE Follow‐On have revolutionized the recovery of higher spatial resolution features of global time‐variable gravity, with SLR continuing to provide the most reliable estimates of C₂₀. We quantify the effect of various SLR processing strategies on estimating C₂₀ and demonstrate better signal recovery with the inclusion of GRACE‐derived low‐degree gravity information in the forward model. This improved SLR product modifies the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheet mass trends by −15.4 and −3.5 Gt/year, respectively, as compared to CSR TN11, and improves global mean sea level budget closure by modifying sea level rise by +0.08 mm/year. We recommend that this new C₂₀ product be applied to RL06 GRACE data products for enhanced accuracy and scientific interpretation.",Positive,Undefined

**The potential for global forest cover**

The restoration of forested land at a global scale could help capture atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. Bastin et al. used direct measurements of forest cover to generate a model of forest restoration potential across the globe (see the Perspective by Chazdon and Brancalion). Their spatially explicit maps show how much additional tree cover could exist outside of existing forests and agricultural and urban land. Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25% increase in forested area, including more than 500 billion trees and more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity. Such a change has the potential to cut the atmospheric carbon pool by about 25%.

**Abstract**

The restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. We mapped the global potential tree coverage to show that 4.4 billion hectares of canopy cover could exist under the current climate. Excluding existing trees and agricultural and urban areas, we found that there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests. This highlights global tree restoration as our most effective climate change solution to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage. We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by ~223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.

&gt;They found that contrails depress the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures, typically decreasing the maximum temperature and raising the minimum temperature. In this respect, the contrail clouds mimic the effect of ordinary clouds.  
&gt;  
&gt;The researchers report that the ""diurnal temperature range was statistically significantly reduced at outbreak stations versus non-outbreak stations."" In the South, this amounted to about a 6 degree Fahrenheit reduction in daily temperature range, while in the Midwest, there was about a 5 degree Fahrenheit reduction. Temperatures the days before and after the outbreaks did not show this effect, indicating that the lower temperatures were due to the contrail outbreaks.

Also,  I'd recommend being careful when going through news sites/subreddits regarding climate reports.

The same goes for commenters; edginess means upvotes in large forums, more often than not. If I can step on my soapbox for a minute for learning about the climate crisis at large,  I'd recommend going to the genuine article to investigate further; find the scientific paper they're reporting about, and read it for yourself! Many are freely available to the public. Some are even directly linked in the news articles  written about them!

We already have enough evidence to reduce emissions, even without all the razzamatazz that people want to shove as evidence of ""We're fucked!"". He may underplay forcings, but I believe this is also as a comparison to the believed estimated. For example in his Arctic fact-check he states that the forcing is more likely to be lower than believed, where the initially believed forcing was \~0.8+ w/m2, when in fact it was more likely to be around \~0.3+ w/m2. 

&amp;#x200B;

In general I believe the author wants to educate people on the relevance of feedback loops and make a dent in the idea of inevitable or abrupt climate change. Some people may misinterpret this as him underplaying or saying there's no risk, but rather he's attempting to deduce and split the more likely risks (Add extra warming, continue to worsen climate change gradually) to the black-swan events, or unlikely risks (Immediate abrupt warming of several degrees, immediate ecosystem collapse, immediate worse climate change)",Positive,Undefined

____

**Significance**

Carbon stored within harvested wood products (HWPs) may be a tool to mitigate climate change, yet its global potential as a carbon sink is unknown and difficult to assess. We show that the global HWP pool was a net sink of 335 Mt of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)⋅y^(−1) in 2015 and as much as 441 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) by 2030, offsetting substantial amounts of industrial process emissions, but only in some countries, and the global contribution is minor, even in a scenario of favorable conditions. Furthermore, economic shocks can turn a country’s HWP pool into a net source of carbon. In conclusion, carbon stored within end-use HWPs varies widely across countries and depends on evolving market forces.

**Abstract**

Carbon stored in harvested wood products (HWPs) can affect national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, in which the production and end use of HWPs play a key role. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides guidance on HWP carbon accounting, which is sensitive to future developments of socioeconomic factors including population, income, and trade. We estimated the carbon stored within HWPs from 1961 to 2065 for 180 countries following IPCC carbon-accounting guidelines, consistent with Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) historical data and plausible futures outlined by the shared socioeconomic pathways. We found that the global HWP pool was a net annual sink of 335 Mt of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)⋅y^(−1) in 2015, offsetting substantial amounts of industrial processes within some countries, and as much as 441 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) by 2030 under certain socioeconomic developments. Furthermore, there is a considerable sequestration gap (71 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) of unaccounted carbon storage in 2015 and 120 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) by 2065) under current IPCC Good Practice Guidance, as traded feedstock is ineligible for national GHG inventories. However, even under favorable socioeconomic conditions, and when accounting for the sequestration gap, carbon stored annually in HWPs is &lt;1% of global emissions. Furthermore, economic shocks can turn the HWP pool into a carbon source either long-term—e.g., the collapse of the USSR—or short-term—e.g., the US economic recession of 2008/09. In conclusion, carbon stored within end-use HWPs varies widely across countries and depends on evolving market forces.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Abstract**

Evidence suggests that 5–15% of the vast pool of soil carbon stored in northern permafrost ecosystems could be emitted as greenhouse gases by 2100 under the current path of global warming. However, direct measurements of changes in soil carbon remain scarce, largely because ground subsidence that occurs as the permafrost soils begin to thaw confounds the traditional quantification of carbon pools based on fixed depths or soil horizons. This issue is overcome when carbon is quantified in relation to a fixed ash content, which uses the relatively stable mineral component of soil as a metric for pool comparisons through time. We applied this approach to directly measure soil carbon pool changes over five years in experimentally warmed and ambient tundra ecosystems at a site in Alaska where permafrost is degrading due to climate change. We show a loss of soil carbon of 5.4% per year (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 9.5) across the site. Our results point to lateral hydrological export as a potential pathway for these surprisingly large losses. This research highlights the potential to make repeat soil carbon pool measurements at sentinel sites across the permafrost region, as this feedback to climate change may be occurring faster than previously thought.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Abstract**

Net anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions must approach zero by mid-century (2050) to stabilize global mean temperature at the levels targeted by international efforts. Yet continued expansion of fossil-fuel energy infrastructure implies already ‘committed’ future CO2 emissions. Here we use detailed datasets of current fossil-fuel-burning energy infrastructure in 2018 to estimate regional and sectoral patterns of ‘committed’ CO2 emissions, the sensitivity of such emissions to assumed operating lifetimes and schedules, and the economic value of associated infrastructure. We estimate that, if operated as historically, existing infrastructure will emit about 658 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 (ranging from 226 to 1,479 Gt CO2 depending on assumed lifetimes and utilization rates). More than half of these emissions are projected to come from the electricity sector, and infrastructure in China, the USA and the EU28 countries represent approximately 41 per cent, 9 per cent and 7 per cent of the total, respectively. If built, proposed power plants (planned, permitted or under construction) would emit approximately an additional 188 (range 37–427) Gt CO2. Committed emissions from existing and proposed energy infrastructure (about 846 Gt CO2) thus represent more than the entire remaining carbon budget if mean warming is to be limited to 1.5 °C with a probability of 50–66 per cent (420–580 Gt CO2), and perhaps two-thirds of the remaining carbon budget if mean warming is to be limited to below 2 °C (1,170–1,500 Gt CO2). The remaining carbon budget estimates are varied and nuanced, depending on the climate target and the availability of large-scale negative emissions. Nevertheless, our emission estimates suggest that little or no additional CO2-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned, and that infrastructure retirements that are earlier than historical ones (or retrofits with carbon capture and storage technology) may be necessary, in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals. On the basis of the asset value per ton of committed emissions, we estimate that the most cost-effective premature infrastructure retirements will be in the electricity and industry sectors, if non-emitting alternative technologies are available and affordable.",Negative,Global stance

For this to happen it seems governments need to accelerate development of small modular molten salt reactors, which are currently a ~decade away.

Existing nuclear reactors (PWR etc.) are just too expensive to install for a variety of reasons, and constructing such machines on-site is too error prone compared to the better quality control that could be achieved with mass production of SMRs.

In fact it was created, but it is not what you think (and want). Several studies along the years which extrapolate the temperature increase based on CO2 are fitted from global model simulations, and you end up with a simple mathematical function. However you're arrested in that particular model tendency and unable to change other parameters.

The problem is that you become very limited as you can only change the parameters that were changed for that particular study (what happens if I change albedo but the simulation results did not considered this).

"Lately I've been seeing a growing irrationality and ignorance coming from the non-denier side of the argument. Here's a rough list of things I can recall:

1. People think the word _pollution_ is a synonym for greenhouse gases. It's gotten so bad that now we have the term _conventional pollution_ to refer to the actual pollution the EPA did battle with from its creation: SOx, NOx, particulates, unburned hydrocarbons, carcinogens, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, oil spills, chemical spills. Some people even believe plastic pollution causes global warming!
1. Some people think we should be ashamed of flying because of GHG emissions. All of global aviation is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions, but now some people are demonizing all flying as if it were a major contributor.
1. People now think the US military is one of the biggest GHG emitters in the world, thanks to an inflammatory article that made the rounds recently. In fact using their own numbers shows that the US military is only responsible for 0.6% of CO2 emissions. It's true that that's more than the lowest 140 countries, but this says more about income inequality, not to mention the small populations of many countries.
1. People think shipping is one of the major GHG emitters in the world. This is related to my first point. Shipping currently uses something called _bunker fuel_ which has a lot of sulfur and burns very dirty, so large ships do emit a lot of pollution. But all of global shipping is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions. The _pollution_ they emit is mostly in the form of soot, SOx, unburned hydrocarbons, and heavy metals, none of which have anything to do with global warming, except that SOx forms aerosols that block the sun and reduce global warming.
1. Many people think we only have 12 years to live. The recent IPCC report said that we need to be on track to have reduced CO2e emissions by 45% by 2030 if we are to stay at or below 1.5C of warming. That's all they said! But a lot of young people now are despondent over living in a world they think is going to be dead by 2030. 

There are a lot of problems with these misconceptions:

1. They distract from the real issues at hand. On an industrial scale, the low hanging fruit for reducing GHGs doesn't lie in small contributors like aviation, shipping, or the military, it lies in reducing coal use, and in massive installation of solar and wind power. Personally I think nuclear also has a large place in this, but I'm not married to that idea if something else is proved to be better.
1. Misconceptions about near-term effects can cause people to give up. If you only have 12, or now 11 years to live, why should you change anything?
1. Unscientific ideas make the 'good' side look ridiculous, and open us up to ridicule and recalcitrance from the other side.

I find this maddening, especially the righteousness of some of the science deniers in the global warming camp. Yes! I said _science deniers in the global warming camp_! Because that's what many of these people are, they deny clear science in favor of a puritanical approach to solving the problem of global warming. Many of them are as difficult to argue against as deniers, because if you dare contradict their edicts, you must be shamed and punished.

I spend more time correcting misconceptions among our own these days than I do with deniers. It seems like denial is dwindling, but irrationality is not. How can this be addressed in this age of fractured and siloed social media?

You think misinformed people have the power to shape nuanced shipping legislation? And their misinformation alone on shipping pollution will result in ineffective action on GW? Just wait until you see Fox news...

Also, 2.5% is substantial, and it's just one of many things. Go back and watch that first 'Inconvenient Truth' - Gore addresses all this with the pie chart diagram. Good things are good, right?   We need many reductions in emissions.

&gt; Project Drawdown is a world-class research organization that reviews, analyses, and identifies the most viable global climate solutions, and shares these findings with the world.",2019,7,Troubling irrationality and ignorance from the 'good' side of the discussion - how to combat it?,"Sounds more like a dare than a serious question...  I'm not sure that's the kind of conversation I'm interested in having - but I'll give it one attempt. Let's start with your first point: 

&gt; People think the word pollution is a synonym for greenhouse gases. It's gotten so bad that now we have the term conventional pollution to refer to...

I know not everyone is familiar with the messaging and public perception war that has been ongoing around this issue for the last thirty years but I'm sure you'll agree that we haven't been winning it. It's important that you first understand that there are three major buckets of players around this issue: 1-people advocating for action on the issue (scientists, advocates, and knowledgeable sane people) 2-the broad lay public who haven't been trained in science or educated on the issue (frequently and effective mis-educated and dis-informed, in fact) and, 3- the opposition (Kochs, API, ACC, Fox, etc).

The problem is that the lay public isn't trained on the science, and formal efforts to provide effective communications about climate to them are swamped and inundated by dis-information from the opposition, which has dramatically more powerful communications channels and techniques. The lay public has a difficult time discerning fact from fiction on this issue, and who could blame them? They haven't been equipped with science training or information, and they have state-of-the-art propaganda, marketing, and disinformation techniques of immense scale arrayed against them. 

Here's how this has played out: initial understanding of global warming was buried by oil companies in the know, then, as academics and public researchers began to understand the problem they faced an uphill battle as they were trained to and were only communicating to students and other academics, hence their message had trouble gaining traction with the lay public. On the other hand, polluters hired Madison Avenue marketing firms and strategic communications consultants. Prominent scientists spent more than a decade with a knife at a gun fight, stubbornly speaking the wrong message from the wrong messenger to the wrong audience, while fossil fuel agents reached the right people in the right way such that awareness of global warming took a serious dip throughout the early-'aughts. These scientists wrung their hands, as you do, over being perfectly accurate and scientifically correct - while our opposition worried about being effective...

I'm not blaming these scientists, or others, but this issue has come a long way - and the twists and turns it's been through in the minds of the public are astounding. For example, the term 'global warming' had built an enormous head of steam (concern, fear) among the lay public around the time just before the first 'Inconvenient Truth' - but it was dashed by clever marketing: fossil fuel interests captured [a brilliant insight](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=72559699567970437507) from conservative messaging gurus, and dramatically moved away from the phrase 'global warming' - and to the phrase 'climate change'.  **Astoundingly, scientists and other pedants climbed aboard** (undoubtedly encouraged by provacatuers) because climate change is *technically* more correct. They just didn't realize they got tricked into losing all their momentum with the lay public...

This is all background and example; here's the point:

For decades the issue has been mired the unhelpful, jargon-y, and pedantic terms 'GHG emissions' and CO2, whatever that is... These terms inspire no worry, motivation, or anything other than a blank face from the lay public. Their eyes glaze over. You're almost as likely to hear that 'CO2 is what we exhale' or '*it's got what plants need*' when you mention it as you are to hear anything insightful - because of extremely effective opposition pr efforts. If you're waiting for *everyone* in the lay public to get a science degree so they can understand the nuance and be technically correct - then we're obviously dead in the water. 

Well, finally, scientists and advocates are now getting smart: you know what term is universally reviled by the public? What term elicits a deeply negative connotation? **Pollution.**  Universally effective messaging. 

So, scientists in-the-know and the greater movement have shifted dramatically to using resonant and effective messages, like 'global warming pollution' and 'coal-plant pollution' - to great effect, and let's hope it's not too late. 

However, you still hear the sticklers saying, 'well, that's not *technically* correct...' and I ask them: ""would you prefer to be technically correct and dead, or technically effective and alive?'

The lay public? Of course many people will get all this confused - but imo, you need to pick the right hill to die on. I might suggest your efforts at correcting people's technicalities may sometimes be better spent in other, more aligned ways. Mind you I'm not giving a pass to misinformation, but it helps to keep a sense of proportion and realistic expectations. 

Ok - that's just a quick take on one single point. Again, I have similar concerns with almost every point. 

Please receive this in the polite, friendly, and hopefully helpful tone as it is intended, and I'm happy to discuss further if you're interested. Also, and perhaps foremost, consider this information as coming from someone who works in this field and has *substantial* experience on this issue, as I have.

You would need to spend at least a month or more just learning about how the model is built and playing around with different case setups before you are ready to play with the settings comfortably as you’re looking for. I would note that the documentation is also limited and a bit cryptic so going at this on your own would be genuinely difficult; a month is probably not enough time. 

Plus, these models don’t run on web browsers or the cloud, so you’ll need access to a supercomputer. Remember that the work that goes into a model is built upon decades of code/research and running models interactively on the web the way you want is a great idea but it would not be feasible for us to allocate funding resources to port a model to that environment. Us being model developers, people who range in various rolls/working groups. One thing that is nice about CESM is that it has a hierarchy of model setups built in, which is something you mention looking for, but I’m not sure how those go once you have a fully-coupled CMIP like simulation.

"Lately I've been seeing a growing irrationality and ignorance coming from the non-denier side of the argument. Here's a rough list of things I can recall:

1. People think the word _pollution_ is a synonym for greenhouse gases. It's gotten so bad that now we have the term _conventional pollution_ to refer to the actual pollution the EPA did battle with from its creation: SOx, NOx, particulates, unburned hydrocarbons, carcinogens, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, oil spills, chemical spills. Some people even believe plastic pollution causes global warming!
1. Some people think we should be ashamed of flying because of GHG emissions. All of global aviation is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions, but now some people are demonizing all flying as if it were a major contributor.
1. People now think the US military is one of the biggest GHG emitters in the world, thanks to an inflammatory article that made the rounds recently. In fact using their own numbers shows that the US military is only responsible for 0.6% of CO2 emissions. It's true that that's more than the lowest 140 countries, but this says more about income inequality, not to mention the small populations of many countries.
1. People think shipping is one of the major GHG emitters in the world. This is related to my first point. Shipping currently uses something called _bunker fuel_ which has a lot of sulfur and burns very dirty, so large ships do emit a lot of pollution. But all of global shipping is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions. The _pollution_ they emit is mostly in the form of soot, SOx, unburned hydrocarbons, and heavy metals, none of which have anything to do with global warming, except that SOx forms aerosols that block the sun and reduce global warming.
1. Many people think we only have 12 years to live. The recent IPCC report said that we need to be on track to have reduced CO2e emissions by 45% by 2030 if we are to stay at or below 1.5C of warming. That's all they said! But a lot of young people now are despondent over living in a world they think is going to be dead by 2030. 

There are a lot of problems with these misconceptions:

1. They distract from the real issues at hand. On an industrial scale, the low hanging fruit for reducing GHGs doesn't lie in small contributors like aviation, shipping, or the military, it lies in reducing coal use, and in massive installation of solar and wind power. Personally I think nuclear also has a large place in this, but I'm not married to that idea if something else is proved to be better.
1. Misconceptions about near-term effects can cause people to give up. If you only have 12, or now 11 years to live, why should you change anything?
1. Unscientific ideas make the 'good' side look ridiculous, and open us up to ridicule and recalcitrance from the other side.

I find this maddening, especially the righteousness of some of the science deniers in the global warming camp. Yes! I said _science deniers in the global warming camp_! Because that's what many of these people are, they deny clear science in favor of a puritanical approach to solving the problem of global warming.

"I saw this graphic and was wondering why CO2 often correlates inversely with temperature.

Does anyone know because of which factors 

1. Temperature went up by 8 degrees Celcius 600M years ago while co2 went down by 30%
2. Temperature went down by 8 degrees celcius while Co2 went up slighly 439M years ago
3. Temperature went up by 8 degrees while co2 didn’t move 270M years ago
4. Temperature went down by 3 degrees celcius while co2 went up by 30% 146M years ago
5. After that, temperature stayed stable for 120M years while CO2 went down

I get that CO2 traps heat, but why doesn’t it seem to correlate with temperature? Co2 only correlates with temperature once 300M years ago and 5 times it didn’t. How so?

It's from a time when it was believed that the earth had a warm phase and a cool phase an alternated between them forever. (As it has in the quaternary.)

This is now refuted, and you need much more sophisticated modelling to extract the temperature. If you do, you find that the climate sensitivity has always been between 1.5 and 6.2°C/CO2 doubling throughout at least the past 420 million years.

Well, temperature will grow so long as the radiative forcing remains. As the temperature of the earth increases its own radiation increases, and so eventually they balance again.

But there's a lot of water in the oceans, so it takes a long time for the temperature rise to finish getting to everywhere. But something in the 25-50 year time frame will see 60% of the temperature change due to an increase in long-lived greenhouse gas to manifest.

&gt;It takes time for temperature growth to catch up with forcing (decades, centuries, millenia depending on TCS or ECS?).

Sure. But if you think about it less as catch up, and more as the increase in temperature having turned on the heat. Like turning on an oven, and waiting for it to get up to temperature. Where it takes  a long time, because it's got a billion cubic kilometres of ocean in it. And 30 million cubic kilometres of ice.

&gt;For example, as methane is initially 120x more potent than CO2 but has a very short half-life, wouldn't this practically nullify the lag for this gas and add immediate warming?

It causes warming at a greater rate. But the time for the warming to have finished doesn't change, no matter the gas (or any other cause of radiative forcing ... an increase in solar irradiance perhaps.)

&gt;Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?

Generally the greenhouse effect decreases with concentration of that greenhouse gas, because some of the heat trapped would have already been trapped. It's approximately logarithmic, so they talk about the climate sensitivity of greenhouse gasses in degrees per doubling, as opposed to degrees per increase. 

The difference in  potency between CH4 and CO2 is nearly completely due to this: CH4 is at much lower concentration, so it warms much more in the current earth's atmosphere.

So I guess the correct answer is it starts at the peak and degrades. But that's for a single burst of greenhouse emissions. The reality is that each year we emit more than the last.",Positive,Global stance

"" Could you please expand on what you mean by: Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?

Basically from what I had understood, the growth of radiative forcing is non-linear due to the  GHG absorption, therefore it would eventually hit a ""peak"" before the gas starts to degrade in the atmosphere. So my understanding was that the absorption/radiative forcing of the gas would hit a peak, and thereafter begin to degrade in the atmosphere.

""The reason the planet takes several decades to respond to increased CO2 is the thermal inertia of the oceans. Consider a saucepan of water placed on a gas stove. Although the flame has a temperature measured in hundreds of degrees C, the water takes a few minutes to reach boiling point. This simple analogy explains climate lag. The mass of the oceans is around 500 times that of the atmosphere. The time that it takes to warm up is measured in decades.""

So, the way I understand it is; carbon and methane contribute differently in time and intensity to radiative forcing. However, thermal lag still occurs regardless of where the radiative forcing is coming from. Remember the Earth's surface is ~70% covered by water. 
First the GHG molecule gets into the atmosphere, then it affects radiative forcing which increases the amount of long wave radiation reflected back to the Earth's surface. (See: earth energy budget) Then it takes awhile for that increased long wave radiation to be absorbed by the oceans/landforms and then have an effect on global temperature due to the scale of the  oceans buffering characteristics. (also see thermohaline circulation) 

Could you please expand on what you mean by:
Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?
And also TCS? ECS? (Equilibrium climate sensitivity? Effective climate sensitivity?)

I hope this was helpful. Please let me know if you have any more questions or need clarification.

It will continue to do so until it leaves the atmosphere. So while the GHG increases the rate of temperature increase AKA radiative forcing as soon as it enters, the extra heat takes time to build up.

The extra warming potential of CH4 means that that one individual molecule has a strong effect, but it lasts for only a couple years before it degrades, probably to CO2. So while one molecule has a rapid warming effect, the best way to think about it is in terms of the whole population of CH4. One molecule degrades fast, but we're adding CH4 so fast that it's concentration continues to build. That CH4 level will provide warming as long as it's around though, so it will carry the same sort of lag as CO2 in the atmosphere.

**Abstract**

The Hadley circulation has large climate impacts at low latitudes by transferring heat and moisture between the tropics and subtropics. Climate projections show a robust weakening of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley circulation by the end of the twenty-first century. Over the past several decades, however, atmospheric reanalyses indicate a strengthening of the Hadley circulation. Here we show that the strengthening of the circulation in the Northern Hemisphere is not seen in climate models; instead, these models simulate a weakening of the circulation in the past 40 years. Using observations and a large ensemble of model simulations we elucidate this discrepancy between climate models and reanalyses, and show that it does not stem from internal climate variability or biases in climate models, but appears related to artefacts in the representation of latent heating in the reanalyses. Our results highlight the role of anthropogenic emissions in the recent slowdown of the atmospheric circulation, which is projected to continue in coming decades, and question the reliability of reanalyses for estimating trends in the Hadley circulation.",Negative,Undefined

**Abstract**

Jakobshavn Isbrae has been the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay’s upper 250 m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavn’s future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.",Negative,Undefined

___

**Abstract**



The climate impact of air traffic is to a large degree caused by changes in cirrus cloudiness resulting from the formation of contrails. Contrail cirrus radiative forcing is expected to increase significantly over time due to the large projected increases in air traffic. We use ECHAM5-CCMod, an atmospheric climate model with an online contrail cirrus parameterization including a microphysical two-moment scheme, to investigate the climate impact of contrail cirrus for the year 2050. We take into account the predicted increase in air traffic volume, changes in propulsion efficiency and emissions, in particular soot emissions, and the modification of the contrail cirrus climate impact due to anthropogenic climate change.

Global contrail cirrus radiative forcing increases by a factor of 3 from 2006 to 2050, reaching 160 or even 180 mW m^(−2), which is the result of the increase in air traffic volume and a slight shift in air traffic towards higher altitudes. Large increases in contrail cirrus radiative forcing are expected over all of the main air traffic areas, but relative increases are largest over main air traffic areas over eastern Asia. The projected upward shift in air traffic attenuates contrail cirrus radiative forcing increases in the midlatitudes but reinforces it in the tropical areas. Climate change has an insignificant impact on global contrail cirrus radiative forcing, while regional changes are significant. Of the emission reductions it is the soot number emission reductions by 50 % that lead to a significant decrease in contrail cirrus optical depth and coverage, leading to a decrease in radiative forcing by approximately 15 %. The strong increase in contrail cirrus radiative forcing due to the projected increase in air traffic volume cannot be compensated for by the decrease in initial ice crystal numbers due to reduced soot emissions and improvements in propulsion efficiency.",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

The Greenland Ice Sheet holds 7.2 m of sea level equivalent and in recent decades, rising temperatures have led to accelerated mass loss. Current ice margin recession is led by the retreat of outlet glaciers, large rivers of ice ending in narrow fjords that drain the interior. We pair an outlet glacier–resolving ice sheet model with a comprehensive uncertainty quantification to estimate Greenland’s contribution to sea level over the next millennium. We find that Greenland could contribute 5 to 33 cm to sea level by 2100, with discharge from outlet glaciers contributing 8 to 45% of total mass loss. Our analysis shows that uncertainties in projecting mass loss are dominated by uncertainties in climate scenarios and surface processes, whereas uncertainties in calving and frontal melt play a minor role. We project that Greenland will very likely become ice free within a millennium without substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

What factors prevented this?","Firstly, CO2 concentrations can influnce the heat carrying of our atmosphere. Given all other variables remain, increasing CO2 concentration in a gaseous mix equivalent to earth's atmosphere will result in temperature increase. This is basic chemistry thta has been demonstrated since the late 1800s. 

[http://web.lemoyne.edu/%7Egiunta/arrhenius.html](http://web.lemoyne.edu/%7Egiunta/arrhenius.html)

 You can even test this in your own home.

Now that we've established that, there are of course other ways to heat up and cool down gases, and our atmosphere.

So the qeustion seems to be, if 150MYA there was a significant overall global temperature increase, was CO2 responsible, or was another variable if the CO2 concentration increases lag behind the temp?

However, there is an even more fundamtental question. Where does that graph come from? Is that data even reliable?

Let's take a look at that graph you provided. The website hosting it is ""[biocab.org](https://biocab.org)"", and their self-description is already somewhat alarming. They seem to see themselves as some kind of arbiter of truth, in a world dominated by the mis-use of knowledge. This ""truther"" type attitude is a bit odd if the source is, in fact, credible. However, we can't dismiss the data just beacsue its host appears unreliable, but at least we should take note of the red flags.

Fortunately the grpahs has provided their source/ reference - Scotese primarily, with some opther data sets added in. It seems that graphs is actually a hand-smoothed curve too, rather than an actual data plot.

"" *The ‘temperature’ record is a hand-drawn schematic derived from the work of Chris Scotese, and the CO2 graph is from a model that uses tectonic and chemical weathering histories to estimate CO2 levels* [*(Berner 1994;*](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/03/can-we-make-better-graphs-of-global-temperature-history/#ITEM-17010-0) [*Berner and Kothavala, 2001)*](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/03/can-we-make-better-graphs-of-global-temperature-history/#ITEM-17010-1)*. In neither case is there an abundance of measured data* ""

As this site points out, there are actually a few versions of that data/ graph lurking about. The scales seems to get regularly changed too, which is a bit concerning:

**Abstract**

Recently, the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has become the main source of barystatic sea-level rise. The increase in the GrIS melt is linked to anticyclonic circulation anomalies, a reduction in cloud cover and enhanced warm-air advection. The Climate Model Intercomparison Project fifth phase (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) do not capture recent circulation dynamics; therefore, regional climate models (RCMs) driven by GCMs still show significant uncertainties in future GrIS sea-level contribution, even within one emission scenario. Here, we use the RCM Modèle Atmosphèrique Règional to show that the modelled cloud water phase is the main source of disagreement among future GrIS melt projections. We show that, in the current climate, anticyclonic circulation results in more melting than under a neutral-circulation regime. However, we find that the GrIS longwave cloud radiative effect is extremely sensitive to the modelled cloud liquid-water path, which explains melt anomalies of +378 Gt yr^–1 (+1.04 mm yr^–1 global sea level equivalent) in a +2 °C-warmer climate with a neutral-circulation regime (equivalent to 21% more melt than under anticyclonic circulation). The discrepancies between modelled cloud properties within a high-emission scenario introduce larger uncertainties in projected melt volumes than the difference in melt between low- and high-emission scenarios.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

For long term policy there is a strong tendency to focus on CO2 as this is a long lasting greenhouse gas. The shorter forcings both positive and negative such as aerosols and methane can largely be eliminated after 2 decades of ceasing to emit them (not quite but within reason for policy decisions) so there is a tendency to fix upon the major long lasting gas, CO2.

AR5 puts the initial potency of methane at 120x, 115x after 5 years, 86 after 20 years, so on so forth. However most of this is never realized due to methane degradation, so the initial potency is honestly pretty irrelevant when it doesn't tell us much about the forcing. In fact, the maximum potential forcing and temperature is most likely never even reached, even if there were to be some sudden, large and rapid methane pulse. This is also due to a lag, it takes time for temperature to catch up with forcing. And by the time it does, the methane would largely be degraded and out of the atmosphere. It does turn into CO2 and H2O, so it does add to the long-tail of climate risks.

Shakhova's work is good, but Hunziker doesn't make a good case for the doom of Earth. Sure, the ESAS may very well contain a lot of carbon, this isn't really disputed. What is disputed is how fast it could release. Shakhova and Semiletov stated a decade ago that ""50 gigatonnes could release"", but haven't made many more studies or claims such as this afterwards.

And according to Atmospheric Scientist Ira Leifer, if a big burst of methane were to happen (He considers it unlikely) civilisation and humans would likely cope, with a lot of casualties. This plays into methanes short lifetime, nature and Earth is great at managing short perturbations (a few decades), but if you do it with CO2 for example (centuries to millenia) it's another story.

**Abstract**

Climate warming in regions of ice‐rich permafrost can result in widespread thermokarst development, which reconfigures the landscape and damages infrastructure. We present multi‐site time‐series observations which couple ground temperature measurements with thermokarst development in a region of very cold permafrost. In the Canadian High Arctic between 2003 and 2016, a series of anomalously warm summers caused mean thawing indices to be 150 – 240 % above the 1979‐2000 normal resulting in up to 90 cm of subsidence over the 12‐year observation period. Our data illustrate that despite low mean annual ground temperatures, very cold permafrost (&lt;‐10°C) with massive ground ice close to the surface is highly vulnerable to rapid permafrost degradation and thermokarst development. We suggest that this is due to little thermal buffering from soil organic layers and near surface vegetation, and the presence of near surface ground ice. Observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090 under RCP 4.5.

**Key Points**

- Observed thermokarst development in very cold permafrost at 3 monitoring sites along a 700 km transect in the Canadian High Arctic.

- Rapid landscape response to above average summer warmth is due to limited thermal buffering from overlying ecosystem components and near‐surface ground ice.

**Abstract**

This paper examines the US military's impact on climate by analysing the geopolitical ecology of its global logistical supply chains. Our geopolitical ecology framework interrogates the material‐ecological metabolic flows (hydrocarbon‐based fuels, water, sand, concrete) that shape geopolitical and geoeconomic power relations. We argue that to account for the US military as a major climate actor, one must understand the logistical supply chain that makes its acquisition and consumption of hydrocarbon‐based fuels possible. Our paper focuses on the US Defense Logistics Agency – Energy (DLA‐E), a large yet virtually unresearched sub‐agency within the US Department of Defense. The DLA‐E is the primary purchase‐point for hydrocarbon‐based fuels for the US military, as well as a powerful actor in the global oil market. After outlining our geopolitical ecology approach, we detail the scope of the DLA‐E's operations, its supply chain, bureaucratic practices, and the physical infrastructure that facilitates the US military's consumption of hydro‐based carbons on a global scale. We show several “path dependencies” – warfighting paradigms, weapons systems, bureaucratic requirements, and waste – that are put in place by military supply chains and undergird a heavy reliance on carbon‐based fuels by the US military for years to come. The paper, based on comprehensive records of bulk fuel purchases we have gathered from DLA‐E through Freedom of Information Act requests, represents a partial yet robust picture of the geopolitical ecology of American imperialism.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Plain Language Summary**

The Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum, characterized by a relatively rapid carbon release to the atmosphere and global warming, has received ample scientific attention owing to its analogy to ongoing climate change. We perform Earth system model projections of concomitant changes in climate, ocean circulation, and marine biogeochemical cycles during the onset of the Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum. In our simulations global warming (induced by atmospheric emissions of CO2) leads to a weakening of the meridional overturning circulation and reduced ventilation of the ocean interior which is more pronounced in the Atlantic than in the Pacific Ocean. As a result of this ocean stagnation, respiratory CO2 released via bacterial remineralization of organic matter (oxygen is thereby consumed) builds up in intermediate waters. This triggers carbonate dissolution and deoxygenation. This mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the asymmetry in the carbonate dissolution proxy record between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

**Abstract**

The Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum was a transient, carbon‐induced global warming event, considered the closest analog to ongoing climate change. Impacts of a decrease in deepwater formation during the onset of the Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum suggested by proxy data on the carbon cycle are not yet fully understood. Using an Earth System Model, we find that changes in overturning circulation are key to reproduce the deoxygenation and carbonate dissolution record. Weakening of the Southern Ocean deepwater formation and enhancement of ocean stratification driven by warming cause an asymmetry in carbonate dissolution between the Atlantic and Pacific basins suggested by proxy data. Reduced ventilation results in accumulation of remineralization products (CO2 and nutrients) in intermediate waters, thereby lowering O2 and increasing CO2. As a result, carbonate dissolution is triggered throughout the water column, while the ocean surface remains supersaturated. Our findings contribute to understanding of the long‐term response of the carbon cycle to climate change.",Negative,Global stance

The Arctic Ocean is projected to become seasonally ice‐free before midcentury unless greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly reduced, but exactly when this could occur depends considerably on internal climate variability. Here we show that trajectories to an ice‐free Arctic are modulated by concomitant shifts in the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Trajectories starting in the negative IPO phase become ice‐free 7 years sooner than those starting in the positive IPO phase. Trajectories starting in the negative IPO phase subsequently transition toward the positive IPO phase, on average, with an associated strengthening of the Aleutian Low, increased poleward energy transport, and faster sea‐ice loss. The observed IPO began to transition away from its negative phase in the past few years. If this shift continues, our results suggest increased likelihood of accelerated sea‐ice loss over the coming decades, and an increased risk of an ice‐free Arctic within the next 20–30 years.

**Plain Language Summary**

Manmade climate change is causing a rapid loss of Arctic sea ice. Summer Arctic sea ice is predicted to disappear almost completely by the middle of this century, unless emissions of greenhouse gases are rapidly reduced. The speed of sea‐ice loss is not constant over time, however. Natural climate variability can add to the manmade decline, leading to faster sea‐ice loss, or can subtract from the manmade decline, leading to slower sea‐ice loss. In this study, we looked at how natural climate variability affects the timing of an ice‐free Arctic. We found that a natural cycle called the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO for short, is particularly important. Arctic sea‐ice loss is faster when the IPO is moving from its cold to warm phase and slower when the IPO is moving from its warm to cold phase. This is because variations in the IPO cause changes in atmospheric wind patterns, which alter the amount of heat that is transported into the Arctic. Observations show that the IPO started to shift from its cold to warm phase in the past few years. If this shift continues, our results suggest that there is an increased chance of accelerated sea‐ice loss over the coming decades.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions
,2019,6,Role of Salt Migration in Destabilization of Intra Permafrost Hydrates in the Arctic shelf: Experimental Modeling,"Abstract: Destabilization of intrapermafrost gas hydrate is one possible reason for methane emission on the Arctic shelf. The formation of these intrapermafrost gas hydrates could occur almost simultaneously with the permafrost sediments due to the occurrence of a hydrate stability zone after sea regression and the subsequent deep cooling and freezing of sediments. The top of the gas hydrate stability zone could exist not only at depths of 200–250 m, but also higher due to local pressure increase in gas-saturated horizons during freezing. Formed at a shallow depth, intrapermafrost gas hydrates could later be preserved and transform into a metastable (relict) state. Under the conditions of submarine permafrost degradation, exactly relict hydrates located above the modern gas hydrate stability zone will, first of all, be involved in the decomposition process caused by negative temperature rising, permafrost thawing, and sediment salinity increasing. That’s why special experiments were conducted on the interaction of frozen sandy sediments containing relict methane hydrates with salt solutions of different concentrations at negative temperatures to assess the conditions of intrapermafrost gas hydrates dissociation. Experiments showed that the migration of salts into frozen hydrate-containing sediments activates the decomposition of pore gas hydrates and increase the methane emission. These results allowed for an understanding of the mechanism of massive methane release from bottom sediments of the East Siberian Arctic shelf.",Positive,Undefined

That is not a judgement of Americans, but there are so many challenges right now that are arguably larger in size that they can directly map themselves to.

There are many problems that are ""more immediate"" but none that are larger in size. We are talking about a mass die off of people. The more deaths in heatwaves is just a tiny, tiny part of it. Mass migrations due to weather and famine. Sea levels will rise and flood many cities, making them unlivable. violence like we haven't known in living history. We are talking about biblical scale apocalypse in the worst case scenarios.

&gt;Second, I really feel this article is counterproductive on some level.  After all, we were just told two weeks ago that we only have 12 years to save humanity.  With some articles literally calling for the end of humanity by 2050.  So, how do these numbers track to those, and if they don't why are we surprised when those we are trying to engage are less than engaging.

The idea behind this is that there is a lag between emissions and the effects of those emissions. If we don't take massive action within 12 years it will be too late to prevent disaster 20 years later.

Say you are trying to boil water over a campfire. You get a pot, fill it with water, and get some wood (fuel). You light your fire. What you should do at this point is wait. Wait and see how big the fire gets, will it boil the water the way it is? What we are actually doing now is saying the water isn't boiling, add some fuel. It's still not boiling add some more fuel. etc. Whats happens is once the water is boiling you have already added so much fuel to the fire it cant be stopped and all your water boils away. The foresight of what will happen in the future is what most people are missing. They say it isn't so bad now, why worry?",Positive,Undefined
,2019,6,Scientists’ warning to humanity: microorganisms and climate change,"This is a *very dense*, *very informative* consensus statement. There is an incredible amount of information here, but I'll put some select quotes below:

&gt;Diatoms perform 25–45% of total primary production in the oceans60,61,62, owing to their prevalence in open-ocean regions when total phytoplankton biomass is maximal63. Diatoms have relatively high sinking speeds compared with other phytoplankton groups, and they account for ~40% of particulate carbon export to depth62,64. Physically driven seasonal enrichments in surface nutrients favour diatom blooms. Anthropogenic climate change will directly affect these seasonal cycles, changing the timing of blooms and diminishing their biomass, which will reduce primary production and CO2 uptake65. Remote sensing data suggest a global decline of diatoms between 1998 and 2012, particularly in the North Pacific, which is associated with shallowing of the surface mixed layer and lower nutrient concentrations46.

and

&gt;Vegetated coastal habitats are important for carbon sequestration, determined by the full trophic spectrum from predators to herbivores, to plants and their associated microbial communities85. Human activity, including anthropogenic climate change, has reduced these habitats over the past 50 years by 25–50%, and the abundance of marine predators has dropped by up to 90%

and

&gt;Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) have expanded in the past 50 years as a result of ocean warming, which reduces oxygen solubility73,74,75. OMZs are global sinks for reactive nitrogen, and microbial production of N2 and N2O accounts for ~25–50% of nitrogen loss from the ocean to the atmosphere. Furthermore, OMZs are the largest pelagic methane reservoirs in the ocean and contribute substantially to open ocean methane cycling. The observed and predicted future expansion of OMZs may therefore considerably affect ocean nutrient and greenhouse gas budgets, and the distributions of oxygen-dependent organisms7
and

&gt;Nevertheless, predictions from global assessments of responses to warming indicate that terrestrial carbon loss under warming is causing a positive feedback that will accelerate the rate of climate change143, particularly in cold and temperate soils, which store much of the global soil carbon147.

and

&gt;If access is taken into account, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels are predicted to allow greater microbial decomposition and less soil retention of organic carbon162.

and

&gt;Elevated CO2 concentrations enhance competition for nitrogen between plants and microorganisms163. Herbivores (invertebrates and mammals) affect the amount of organic matter that is returned to soil and thereby microbial biomass and activity164. For example, grasshoppers diminish plant biomass and plant nitrogen demand, thereby increasing microbial activity163. Climate change can reduce herbivory, resulting in overall alterations to global nitrogen and carbon cycles that reduce terrestrial carbon sequestration163.

and

&gt;Climate change is predicted to increase the rate of antibiotic resistance of some human pathogens236. Data from 2013–2015 suggest that an increase of the daily minimum temperature by 10 °C (which is conceivable for some parts of the USA by the end of the century) will lead to an increase in antibiotic resistance rates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by 2–4% (up to 10% for certain antibiotics)

and finally 

&gt;Across marine and terrestrial biomes, microbially driven greenhouse gas emissions are increasing and positively feeding back on climate change. Irrespective of the fine details, the microbial compass points to the need to act (Box 2). Ignorance of the role of, effects on and feedback response of microbial communities to climate change can lead to our own peril. An immediate, sustained and concerted effort is required to explicitly include microorganisms in research, technology development, and policy and management decisions. Microorganisms not only contribute to the rate of climate change but can also contribute immensely to its effective mitigation and our adaptation tools.",Positive,Undefined

,2019,6,Are there models predicting how specific climates throughout the world will be affected if we continue to release carbon at the current rate?,"There are regional models which cover global regions like north america, for example, so these are quite large. Downscaling these models usually happens with various organisations within a country. For example, in Canada, we have a few NGOs that do this, for example, the Pacific Climate Impact Consortium. Also, the federal government is working on a national portal to bring these downscaled impacts together and easier to search and understand.

So basically what you're asking about is being done, slowly, because it is quite difficult, requiring lots of data and computer power to run models. There are some general rules of thumb emerging, for instance, that currently dry areas will get drier, and wet ones, wetter - although I would bet there will be exceptions. Of course, as you mentioned, many areas will be submerged from ice melt, although some areas will rise. This is due continental glacial rebound, I.e. glaciers currently weighing down on land area will stop putting that downward pressure on the land mass as it melts, thus allowing the land mass to rise, which can reduce or overtake sea level rise in some cases.

This paper summarizes current understanding of the processes that determine the dynamics of the subsea permafrost–hydrate system existing in the largest, shallowest shelf in the Arctic Ocean; the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). We review key environmental factors and mechanisms that determine formation, current dynamics, and thermal state of subsea permafrost, mechanisms of its destabilization, and rates of its thawing; a full section of this paper is devoted to this topic. Another important question regards the possible existence of permafrost-related hydrates at shallow ground depth and in the shallow shelf environment. We review the history of and earlier insights about the topic followed by an extensive review of experimental work to establish the physics of shallow Arctic hydrates. We also provide a principal (simplified) scheme explaining the normal and altered dynamics of the permafrost–hydrate system as glacial–interglacial climate epochs alternate. We also review specific features of methane releases determined by the current state of the subsea-permafrost system and possible future dynamics. This review presents methane results obtained in the ESAS during two periods: 1994–2000 and 2003–2017. A final section is devoted to discussing future work that is required to achieve an improved understanding of the subject.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Fluctuations in glacier motion are very common and are thought to be controlled by subglacial hydrology and till deformation. There are few instrumented studies that have monitored seasonal changes. We use the innovative Glacsweb subglacial in situ wireless probes, combined with dGPS and custom geophone data from an Icelandic soft-bedded temperate glacier, to show that there are two distinct seasonal styles of speed-up events. Relatively small diurnal events occur during the melt season, whilst during winter there are larger multi-day events related to positive degree days. These events are accompanied by a distinct pattern of till deformation and basal icequakes. We argue these reflect stick-slip motion which occurs when the glacier hydrological system is unable to accommodate the melt water flux generated by surface melt episodes. We show a rare fully instrumented coupled glacier/till record of contrasting summer and winter stick-slip motion and discuss its implication for till sedimentology.",Negative,Global stance

The more methane you add, the less the effect of adding any given amount, so you can't simply multiply the amount you add times the current effect of adding a small amount.

Yes, the methane gets oxidized before you see the full temperature impact, even if you add it all at once.

There are some factors which seem to increase sensitivity as you move farther away from normal.

Methane lives longer the more you have, although this seems to be overemphasized in my opinion because destruction by tropical lightning isn't remotely close to saturated.

The clouds used in climate models are generated by parameterizations generated by observations around current values.  
We can increasingly simulate these clouds directly on small scales (not climate model scales).  This seems to indicate that the values used in climate models are wrong in climates much warmer than currently exist.  This seems to indicate that past a certain level of global warmth, you get a sizeable abrupt upward shift in global temperatures associated with the disappearance of temperate marine cloud decks.

"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm not a climate skeptic, just genuinely curious.  

As I understand it, scientists estimate past CO2 levels by taking ice core data.  They take the ice cores, sample the CO2 level in a certain section, so they can say that the CO2 ppm was ""so and so"" this many years ago.  

But how are current CO2 measurements taken?  The way I see it (and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), there are two ways to get comparable data from today.  

1) take ice core samples from the present day (1950-present), and use that as your CO2 benchmark  

2) ascertain that air samples (like ones from Mauna Loa) are equivalent to ice core samples in terms of CO2 concentration.  I imagine this could be done by letting water freeze in several chambers that vary by CO2 level, and then testing the CO2 level of the ice.  

If anyone could confirm that one of these is true, (or quell my doubt in any other way) I would appreciate it.

In the foreseeable future there will always be a lot of Earth that's dry and at human-friendly temperatures, and you would have to work pretty hard to find a reputable climate scientist in the 21st century who has said otherwise. 

The ultimate outcome for human society is a very complicated question to answer. Even in 2019, we have more migrants and refugees than at any point in human history. It amounts to a global humanitarian crisis which has already reshaped politics in many or most countries. So what do you think will happen if entire islands and cities start to go underwater, and all *those* people have to find new places to live?

How about agriculture? If it gets bad enough, a lot of our farmland will gradually have to change over to different crops because the local climate is no longer suitable. Planting new crops and learning to grow them and set up global supply chains for them is no small task. Never mind the fishing industry, which is obviously right on the coast: how many fishermen will go out of business or lose their homes and be forced to move inland?

Now, modern farmers and fish tycoons and people in general are pretty smart at figuring this sort of thing out. But they'll *also* be dealing with the refugee crisis and its economic and political consequences—which will only be worsened if we see any kind of food shortages.

I've only named a couple of problems, but already it's easy to see how they could spiral completely out of control if they get bad enough.

Rising temperatures means the thermal expansion of the ocean and melting of land ice, both of which make sea level rise faster.

**Highlights**

 • Bitcoin's annual electricity consumption adds up to 45.8 TWh

 • The corresponding annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2

 • This level sits between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka

**Context &amp; Scale**

Blockchain technology has its roots in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which was the first successful attempt to validate transactions via a decentralized data protocol. This validation process requires vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant level of carbon emissions. Our approximation of Bitcoin’s carbon footprint underlines the need to tackle the environmental externalities that result from cryptocurrencies.
Blockchain solutions are increasingly discussed for a broad variety of use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. Although not all blockchain protocols are as energy intensive as Bitcoin’s protocol, environmental aspects, the risk of collusion, and concerns about control must not be ignored in the debate on anticipated benefits. Our findings for the first stage of blockchain diffusion and the externalities we discuss may help policy-makers in setting the right rules as the adoption journey of blockchain technology has just started.

**Summary**

Participation in the Bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialized hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2. This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

,2019,6,"Marine life decreases by 5 % with every 1 °C increase in the temperature of the oceans, according to a new study. The study projects a 17 % loss of marine biomass by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions stay at the present rate.","Study (open access): [Global ensemble projections reveal trophic amplification of ocean biomass declines with climate change](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/06/10/1900194116)
____

**Significance**

Climate change can affect the distribution and abundance of marine life, with consequences for goods and services provided to people. Because different models can lead to divergent conclusions about marine futures, we present an integrated global ocean assessment of climate change impacts using an ensemble of multiple climate and ecosystem models. It reveals that global marine animal biomass will decline under all emission scenarios, driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production. Notably, climate change impacts are amplified at higher food web levels compared with phytoplankton. Our ensemble projections provide the most comprehensive outlook on potential climate-driven ecological changes in the global ocean to date and can inform adaptive management and conservation of marine resources under climate change.

**Abstract**

While the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5% (±4% SD) under low emissions and 17% (±11% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5% decline for every 1 °C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

___

**Abstract**

Extremely high temperatures pose an immediate threat to humans and ecosystems. In recent years, many regions on land and in the ocean experienced heatwaves with devastating impacts that would have been highly unlikely without human‐induced climate change. Impacts are particularly severe when heatwaves occur in regions with high exposure of people or crops. The recent 2018 spring‐to‐summer season was characterized by several major heat and dry extremes. On daily average between May and July 2018 about 22% of the populated and agricultural areas north of 30 degrees latitude experienced concurrent hot temperature extremes. Events of this type were unprecedented prior to 2010, while similar conditions were experienced in the 2010 and 2012 boreal summers. Earth System Model (ESM) simulations of present‐day climate, that is, at around +1°C global warming, also display an increase of concurrent heat extremes. Based on ESM simulations we show that it is virtually certain} (using IPCC calibrated uncertainty language) that the 2018 North‐Hemispheric concurrent heat events would not have occurred without human‐induced climate change. Our results further reveal that the average high‐exposure area projected to experience concurrent warm and hot spells in the Northern Hemisphere increases by about 16% per additional +1°C of global warming. A strong reduction in fossil fuel emissions is paramount to reduce the risks of unprecedented global‐scale heatwave impacts.",Positive,Global stance

I can see the support for that argument, but my perspective is that if things get that bad then the banks won't be able to enforce foreclosures - either because the banks won't be operating, or law enforcement will have bigger problems than processing evictions.

I don't feel like I have all of the answers, and I look forward to seeing what others are doing, but here's where I'm at.  


We have bought a plain house that suits our simple needs (for a family of 5) and isn't extravagant. We will be able to pay it off reasonably quickly, and much faster than if we had borrowed all the bank would have let us have.  


We have a little bit of space around our block and have the opportunity for some guerilla gardening. We've planted a few fruit trees on the surrounding land since we moved in 18 months ago. I figure these will take time to grow and start producing a good crop, and that planting fruit trees is something that is better to do now rather than later. We have also started to care for the fruit trees others have planted in the past. They are well established and so don't need watering, but were very overgrown and needed a good pruning. It might take them a year or two to recover at this point, but then they will produce even better.  


We are also looking at buying a small parcel of surrounding land to grow more vegetables. On that topic, I've dabbled for a few years now in growing vegetables. Five years ago we moved to a new climate, so I've worked to learn what works here. I still buy the bulk of our vegetables from the supermarket as it is more cost effective, but I am building the skills so that if I did have to ramp up production at home I should have some success and knowledge.  


We work to keep our wants simple and expenses low. Controlling desires is very important. I also find it very useful to stop before making a purchase and take some time to see if I can come up with a clever alternative or fix for what I am thinking of purchasing. I believe ingenuity will be important in the future. I also try to develop this in our children. They will need to be adaptable problem solvers to have the best shot.  


Although we have purchased a property I also try to have a mindset of being ready to up sticks and move on. At this stage I am not convinced that setting ourselves up for one location is the best option. I think it is better to be prepared to be transient and see how things pan out then make the best choices you can at that time, with what is happening at that time and the information you have at that time. We are making some changes here, such as better insulation (cold climate) and planting those fruit trees, but I am not ready to invest everything in this one shot.  


We are also working on improving our physical fitness and staying healthy. I feel so grateful to live in a time of excellent medical care, but I am not convinced the system won't become over stretched in the future. We need to do what we can to care for our bodies. I think general good health and some physical ability will also make it easier to grow food, walk where we need, generally adapt.

**Abstract**

In the past, human migrations have been associated with climate change. As our civilizations developed, humans depended less on the environment, in particular on climate, because technological and economic development in the span of human history allowed us to adapt to and overcome environmental discomfort. Asian Russia (east of the Urals to the Pacific) is known to be sparsely populated. The population is concentrated along the forest-steppe in the south, with its comfortable climate and thriving agriculture on fertile soils. We use current and predicted climate scenarios to evaluate the climate comfort of various landscapes to determine the potential for human settlers throughout the 21st century. Climate change scenarios are taken from 20 CMIP5 general circulation models. Two CO2 Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios, RCP 2.6 representing mild climate change and RCP 8.5 representing more extreme changes, are applied to the large subcontinental territory of Asian Russia. The ensemble January and July temperature anomaly means and annual precipitation are calculated with respect to the baseline 1961–1990 climate. Three climate indices, which are important for human livelihood and well-being, are calculated based on January and July temperatures and annual precipitation: Ecological Landscape Potential, winter severity, and permafrost coverage. Climates predicted by the 2080s over Asian Russia would be much warmer and milder. Ensemble means do not show extreme aridity. The permafrost zone is predicted to significantly shift to the northeast. Ecological Landscape Potential would increase 1–2 categories from 'low' to 'relatively high' which would result in a higher capacity for population density across Asian Russia. Socio-economic processes and policy choices will compel the development that will lead to attracting people to migrate throughout the century. Therefore, understanding ecological landscape potential is crucial information for developing viable strategies for long-term economic and social development in preparation for climate migration and strategic adaptation planning.",Positive,Global stance

I will say: from what I've been researching, that methane emission paper you're talking about says that the emissions from US INDUSTRY are potentially a hundred times higher. Specifically, they found the US fertilizer industry's reported methane emissions - through the six fertilizer plants that they were studying - were inaccurate to what was actually emitted, as well as inaccurate to what the EPA was saying the country's leaked methane emissions were (here's the actual scientific paper, for reference [https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.358/](https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.358/)). If that's true, then what else are the EPA and individual industries 'looking the other way' for when they report their emissions?

&gt;""The team found that 0.34% of the gas used in the plants \[in the United States\] ends up in the atmosphere - scaled up across the entire industry, this suggests total annual methane emissions would total 28 gigagrams, vastly exceeding the 0.2 gigagrams reported by the sector.""

That's still disturbing news, but it's only changing where we understand the current methane level increases - current levels are around 1,866 PPB, if the 2 Degree Institute is right with their numbers [https://www.methanelevels.org/](https://www.methanelevels.org/)  \-  are *actually* coming from. It's not reporting a new/unexpected increase in the level of methane in the atmosphere, but focusing on exactly what's causing that methane level we already know about to rise so fast... and how cowardly government and company officials can be in taking responsibility for corporate emissions. In a way, that's decent news because it's putting more of those emissions on human shoulders; they're in the atmosphere specifically, *directly* because of our doing, and our interference can change how much they emit (for better or worse). Because they're at fertilizer plants that doesn't make it easy to change, but... still.

____

**Abstract**

Mass mortality events are increasing in frequency and magnitude, potentially linked with ongoing climate change. In October 2016 through January 2017, St. Paul Island, Bering Sea, Alaska, experienced a mortality event of alcids (family: Alcidae), with over 350 carcasses recovered. Almost three-quarters of the carcasses were unscavenged, a rate much higher than in baseline surveys (17%), suggesting ongoing deposition and elevated mortality around St Paul over a 2–3 month period. Based on the observation that carcasses were not observed on the neighboring island of St. George, we bounded the at-sea distribution of moribund birds, and estimated all species mortality at 3,150 to 8,800 birds. The event was particularly anomalous given the late fall/winter timing when low numbers of beached birds are typical. In addition, the predominance of Tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata, 79% of carcass finds) and Crested auklets (Aethia cristatella, 11% of carcass finds) was unusual, as these species are nearly absent from long-term baseline surveys. Collected specimens were severely emaciated, suggesting starvation as the ultimate cause of mortality. The majority (95%, N = 245) of Tufted puffins were adults regrowing flight feathers, indicating a potential contribution of molt stress. Immediately prior to this event, shifts in zooplankton community composition and in forage fish distribution and energy density were documented in the eastern Bering Sea following a period of elevated sea surface temperatures, evidence cumulatively suggestive of a bottom-up shift in seabird prey availability. We posit that shifts in prey composition and/or distribution, combined with the onset of molt, resulted in this mortality event.",Positive,Undefined

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;The process of CO2 valorization—from capture of CO2 to its electrochemical upgrade—requires significant inputs in each of the capture, upgrade, and separation steps. Here we report an electrolyzer that upgrades carbonate electrolyte from CO2 capture solution to syngas, achieving 100% carbon utilization across the system. A bipolar membrane is used to produce proton in situ to facilitate CO2 release at the membrane:catalyst interface from the carbonate solution. Using a Ag catalyst, we generate syngas at a 3:1 H2:CO ratio, and the product is not diluted by CO2 at the gas outlet; we generate this pure syngas product stream at a current density of 150 mA/cm2 and an energy efficiency of 35%. The carbonate-to-syngas system is stable under a continuous 145 h of catalytic operation. The work demonstrates the benefits of coupling CO2 electrolysis with a CO2 capture electrolyte on the path to practicable CO2 conversion technologies.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

I think what people are saying is there is natural carbon cycle co2 and then the bit humans add to the mix and this addition is the cause of climate change.

it has been shown in a link that we can see the rate of human addition, through ice core analysis, and calculations of the amount of fossil fuels we have added over the past 300 years or so.

and also that the overall system cannot  act as a buffer from the Human additions.

&amp;#x200B;

do humans decide to reduce carbon emissions at all costs? 

and try and remove as much co2 from the atmosphere as possible? or learn to adapt to the changes coming.

1) ""what are the facts?"" No one has actually done a complete termite survey, you can tell how much CO2 and ch4 comes from a terminate, in a lab. But not how many there are.. nor how varied so it's all conjecture. That's the fact, all the rest is conjecture. 

Funny story/fact Jerry Mahlman who is dead now but was the head of NOAA's Geophysicalfluiddynamicslab (the folks who make the GCMs aka climate models)  he told me you can use science to argue any agenda. 

So it's easy to say maybe termites are ""causing more CO2 than humans"" but that's specious. Termites have been here way longer than us by millions of years-- eating wood and waster and farting out CH4 and CO2 they're part of the Carbon cycle.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. The number of citations does not contribute to the total of indexed results. I can make very specific searches that show fewer indexed results than there are citations of the first result. For example there are only two results for this [search](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=%22Climate+change+1995.+Impacts%2C+adaptations+and+mitigation+of+climate+change%3A+scientific-technical+analyses%22&amp;btnG=) but the first result is cited over 1000 times. But anyway, I can remove the inclusion of patents and citations and there are still ~2.5 millions results for [""climate change""](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1%2C50&amp;as_vis=1&amp;q=%22climate+change%22&amp;btnG=). 

&gt;If you remove the quotes then every article in its database that has the word ""change"" gets counted.

That is not how it works. If I search the word [change](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=change&amp;btnG=) there are more results (~7.9 million) than there are for [climate change](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=climate+change&amp;btnG=)(~3.5 million). Similarly there are more results for the term [climate](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=climate&amp;btnG=) (~4.1 million). The reason I included it without the quotes is because there likely exists papers that discuss climate change or global warming without explicitly using the exact phrases.


&gt;examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming.

I think I am missing your point here. I don't see a contradiction.

&gt;I guess you and I have differing standards when we ask for evidence.

This seems needlessly hostile, but I suppose it's accurate. I do think a google scholar search is a reasonable proxy for an order of magnitude estimate and apparently you do not. It's not a particularly bold claim and it's not particularly critical to the argument. The paper you cite is essentially pointing out the same idea: many more papers say AWG is happening than say that it isn't. If someone has a better estimate I'd be open to it, but frankly I don't find it all that important or interesting.",Positive,Undefined

"I know there is a lag in the heating just like it takes time for your body to warm up after you put a blanket on, but how much heating would happen this century from the carbon dioxide that has already been released?

I also know there is an effect that some of the particles from burning coal are blocking some energy from warming the Earth, how much would this warm the Earth if we stopped burning coal?

Are there any other reasons the Earth would keep heating up if we stopped burning fossil fuels right now?",2019,5,How much would the Earth warm if we stopped burning fossil fuels today?,"&gt;It is an area of the biggest uncertainty. \[...\] It would likely take a serious model simulation to get a definitive answer and then it would have some inbuilt assumptions. \[...\] Its an open question and perhaps one we can learn from by thinking about.

Yes, I agree. It's important to note that the greatest potential effect of aerosols is in their indirect effect on cloud cover, which is untenably uncertain (the primary reason for those 'inbuilt assumptions').  This thread basically concerns ideas like Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, if I'm not mistaking, and climate sensitivity continues to represent disagreement among climatologists.  In fact, in addition to the spread of diverse projections, we still have estimates coming to the same conclusions via completely separate explanations, due primarily to cloud cover and its relationship with the oceans.

As far as we know, I can continue to claim that the climate is more sensitive than the average climatologist expects, due to the influence of oceans and cloud cover (particularly low cloud cover), and if anyone wants to disprove me (solving this disagreement) they will have to fund a nice handful of satellites to continuously monitor the oceans for cloud cover, over decades.  I continue to expect, for example, that as the 'warm' phase of the PDO rolls around in \~2035, we will already have been surprised by the severity of these changes, due to our uncertainty, and thus far science has always panned-out this possibility, as far as I have seen.",Positive,Undefined

Ok, excluding control returns 800k results.  Not quite a million, but still a lot.  To be fair, I did say ""*hundreds of thousands* if not millions"".  It was an estimate.  The exact number does not really matter for the point I was making, which is that in the scheme of things, 40 papers is not that much.  Even if it turns out to only be 4,000 papers total that have been written on climate change (which is clearly an absurdly low estimate, but using that number to illustrate the point), that's only 1% of all papers that allegedly refute the theory of anthopogenic climate change.  All of this ignoring the fact that none of the papers cited actually do that.  

&gt;But I see you are the type who makes claims first, then scrambles to force validation later rather than thinks about what they are saying. 

I see you are the type who engages in pedantic debates, rather than analyzing the actual substance of the argument being made.

&gt;That is irrelevant. Your claim was that there were 40 papers vs ""millions""

It's highly relevant, even despite the exceedingly small number of papers that are cited here, since it completely negates the argument being made if none of the studies are even making the claims that are being asserted.

&gt;Here is what you originally said. 

&gt;Using the examples you provided, for the one about greenland being no warmer than it was a century ago,

&gt;And here is your following comment. 

&gt;It shows that very recently, in the 90's there was a high degree of warming, greater than there had been in the last century.

&gt;These contradict each other.

I don't see how these contradict each other.  The first quote is my intepretation of what was being asserted by the OP, and the second quote is my intepretation of the paper.  I should hope they are not the same argument, since I am intending to refute the argument being made, and it would be nonsensical to make the very same argument I am attempting to refute.

&gt;And I am not sure they have much to do with the main focus of the Mikkelsen, Grinsted, Ditlevsen paper which is mostly about sea ice balance. 

&gt;The supplementary material seems to be creating input data for a model. I am really not following what you and the opening post are getting from this. 

&gt;The authors do have this

&gt;Observed fluctuations in Greenland temperature Surface temperature anomalies were obtained from (KNMI). We use the “Twentieth Century Reanalysis V2c” from the years 1851 to 2011 in a box spanning 68◦N to 80◦N and 25◦W to 60◦W. The raw data consists of monthly means and are shown in Figure 2 as the blue curve.

&gt;With a graphic but I am really sure that should not be used to make claims about Greenlands average temperature without clarifying wiht the authors where the data came from and what it is supposed to represent. These are foot notes for modellers not actual temperature time series.

Yes, this is also an argument that I made, that the study was not even intended to be used for the purpose of measuring temperature, but rather to  create a model of greenland ice based on temperature.  I was simply highlighting that even if you were to use for the purpose that the link the OP posted had used it for, it would still not show what they are claiming.  So not only is it being used improperly, it is also not showing what the OP claims it is showing.",Positive,Undefined

We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming.** Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.

These contradict each other. And I am not sure they have much to do with the main focus of the Mikkelsen,  Grinsted,  Ditlevsen paper which is mostly about sea ice balance. 

The supplementary material seems to be creating input data for a model. I am really not following what you and the opening post are getting from this.

The raw data consists of monthly means and are shown in Figure 2 as the blue curve.

In any case, using the graph they provided, it is actually the warmest it has ever been in Greenland, if you look right at the end of the graph.

Regarding the second greenland study, I'll just provide this quote directly that warns against interpreting it inaccurately:

""Whilst a lack of marked warming trends during the last 15 years can restrain permafrost thaw, it should not be over-interpreted, since we cannot differentiate between anthropogenic forcing and natural fluctuations in this study.""

Global-scale 21st-century glacier mass change projections from six published global glacier models are systematically compared as part of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project. In total 214 projections of annual glacier mass and area forced by 25 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios and aggregated into 19 glacier regions are considered. Global mass loss of all glaciers (outside the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets) by 2100 relative to 2015 averaged over all model runs varies from 18 ± 7% (RCP2.6) to 36 ± 11% (RCP8.5) corresponding to 94 ± 25 and 200 ± 44 mm sea-level equivalent (SLE), respectively. Regional relative mass changes by 2100 correlate linearly with relative area changes. For RCP8.5 three models project global rates of mass loss (multi-GCM means) of &gt;3 mm SLE per year towards the end of the century. Projections vary considerably between regions, and also among the glacier models. Global glacier mass changes per degree global air temperature rise tend to increase with more pronounced warming indicating that mass-balance sensitivities to temperature change are not constant. Differences in glacier mass projections among the models are attributed to differences in model physics, calibration and downscaling procedures, initial ice volumes and varying ensembles of forcing GCMs.",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

Periodic changes in sediment composition are usually ascribed to insolation forcing controlled by Earth’s orbital parameters. During the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum at 97–91 Myr ago (Ma), a 37–50-kyr-long cycle that is generally believed to reflect obliquity forcing dominates the sediment record. Here, we use a numerical ocean model to show that a cycle of this length can be generated by marine biogeochemical processes without applying orbital forcing. According to our model, the restricted proto-North Atlantic and Tethys basins were poorly ventilated and oscillated between iron-rich and sulfidic (euxinic) states. The Panthalassa Basin was fertilized by dissolved iron originating from the proto-North Atlantic. Hence, it was less oxygenated while the proto-North Atlantic was in an iron-rich state and better oxygenated during euxinic periods in the proto-North Atlantic. This redox see-saw was strong enough to create significant changes in atmospheric pCO₂. We conclude that most of the variability in the mid-Cretaceous ocean–atmosphere system can be ascribed to the internal redox see-saw and its response to external orbital forcing.",Positive,Undefined

The negative radiative forcing from the increased shielding by clouds is somewhere between 0.06 and 1.33 watts per meter squared. As I understand it the higher figure is dependent on estimates of low aerosol cooling the in preindustrial, that is strongly challenged at the moment. 

It is an area of the biggest uncertainty. But roughly speaking the mid point in that figure is close to the total forcing from methane that will rapidly drop off once human sources are stopped. 

It would likely take a serious model simulation to get a definitive answer and then it would have some inbuilt assumptions. But perhaps a jump of a few tenths of a degree followed by a bit of a cooling back to near current temperatures as CH4 changes to CO2?

Examining the equation using a λ of 0.5 K/(W/m^2 ) results in the following:

dTs = λ*dF where dTs is the change (delta) in temperature at the surface (Ts)

dTs = (0.5)[5.35ln(415/280)] ∴ dTs = 1.05 °C

dF = 5.35 ln(C/C_0)

Where 'dF' is the radiative forcing in W/m^2 , 'C' is the concentration of atmospheric CO2, and 'C_0' is the reference CO2 concentration. Normally the value of C_0 is chosen at the pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppmv.

Using the formula from above, we can view atmospheric CO2 derived from the RF of each RCP scenario:

RCP 2.6 = 455ppm CO2

RCP 4.5 = 649ppm CO2

RCP 6.0 = 859ppm CO2

RCP 8.5 = 1371ppm CO2

As a check, we can input 455ppm CO2, rearrange the equation, and solve for x as follows: (e^(x/5.35))*280 = 455 and sure enough we get our approximate answer of 2.597 or ~2.6 W/m^2 as noted in the above RCPs.

___

**Significance**

It has long been observed that the sequence of sedimentary rocks deposited in the past half-billion years often sharply overlies older igneous or metamorphic basement at an erosional surface known as the Great Unconformity. We provide evidence that this unconformity may record rapid erosion during Neoproterozoic “snowball Earth” glaciations. We show that the extent of Phanerozoic sedimentation in shallow continental seas can be accurately reproduced by modeling the accommodation space produced by the proposed glacial erosion, underlining the importance of glaciation as a means for lowering erosional base level. These results provide constraints on the sedimentary and geochemical environment in which the first multicellular animals evolved and diversified in the “Cambrian explosion” following the unconformity.

**Abstract**

The Great Unconformity, a profound gap in Earth’s stratigraphic record often evident below the base of the Cambrian system, has remained among the most enigmatic field observations in Earth science for over a century. While long associated directly or indirectly with the occurrence of the earliest complex animal fossils, a conclusive explanation for the formation and global extent of the Great Unconformity has remained elusive. Here we show that the Great Unconformity is associated with a set of large global oxygen and hafnium isotope excursions in magmatic zircon that suggest a late Neoproterozoic crustal erosion and sediment subduction event of unprecedented scale. These excursions, the Great Unconformity, preservational irregularities in the terrestrial bolide impact record, and the first-order pattern of Phanerozoic sedimentation can together be explained by spatially heterogeneous Neoproterozoic glacial erosion totaling a global average of 3–5 vertical kilometers, along with the subsequent thermal and isostatic consequences of this erosion for global continental freeboard.",Positive,Global stance

___

**Abstract**

Permafrost is a key element of the cryosphere and an essential climate variable in the Global Climate Observing System. There is no remote-sensing method available to reliably monitor the permafrost thermal state. To estimate permafrost distribution at a hemispheric scale, we employ an equilibrium state model for the temperature at the top of the permafrost (TTOP model) for the 2000–2016 period, driven by remotely-sensed land surface temperatures, down-scaled ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data, tundra wetness classes and landcover map from the ESA Landcover Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Subgrid variability of ground temperatures due to snow and landcover variability is represented in the model using subpixel statistics. The results are validated against borehole measurements and reviewed regionally. The accuracy of the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost is ±2 °C when compared to permafrost borehole data. The modelled permafrost area (MAGT &lt;0 °C) covers 13.9 × 106  km^2 (ca. 15% of the exposed land area), which is within the range or slightly below the average of previous estimates. The sum of all pixels having isolated patches, sporadic, discontinuous or continuous permafrost (permafrost probability &gt;0) is around 21 × 106 km^2 (22% of exposed land area), which is approximately 2 × 106  km^2 less than estimated previously. Detailed comparisons at a regional scale show that the model performs well in sparsely vegetated tundra regions and mountains, but is less accurate in densely vegetated boreal spruce and larch forests.",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

Atmospheric aerosols are complex mixtures of different chemical species, and individual particles exist in many different shapes and morphologies. Together, these characteristics contribute to the aerosol mixing state. This review provides an overview of measurement techniques to probe aerosol mixing state, discusses how aerosol mixing state is represented in atmospheric models at different scales, and synthesizes our knowledge of aerosol mixing state's impact on climate‐relevant properties, such as cloud condensation and ice nucleating particle concentrations, and aerosol optical properties. We present these findings within a framework that defines aerosol mixing state along with appropriate mixing state metrics to quantify it.

**Abstract**

The early 20th century warming (EW; 1910-1945) and the mid-20th century cooling (MC; 1950-1980) have been linked to both, internal variability of the climate system and changes in external radiative forcing. The degree to which either of the two factors contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean variability was unlikely to be the driver of observed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) after 1850 A.D. Instead, virtually all (97-98%) of the global low-frequency variability (&gt; 30 years) can be explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages of explained variance for inter-hemispheric and land-ocean temperature evolution. Three key aspects are identified which underpin the conclusion of this new study: inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER), biases in the instrumental sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, and inadequate representation of the response to varying forcing factors. Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted for, the MC period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and observations during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) is found to be primarily controlled by external forcing too. Future attribution studies should account for these important factors when discriminating between externally-forced and internally generated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must not be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead (North Atlantic Variability Index; NAVI). Our associated best estimate for the transient climate response (TCR) is 1.57 K (±0.70 at the 5-95% confidence level).",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

We outline a new and improved uncertainty analysis for the Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature product version 4 (GISTEMP v4). Historical spatial variations in surface temperature anomalies are derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys and other sensors. Uncertainties arise from measurement uncertainty, changes in spatial coverage of the station record, and systematic biases due to technology shifts and land cover changes. Previously published uncertainty estimates for GISTEMP included only the effect of incomplete station coverage. Here, we update this term using currently available spatial distributions of source data, state‐of‐the‐art reanalyses and incorporate independently derived estimates for ocean data processing, station homogenization and other structural biases. The resulting 95% uncertainties are near 0.05° C in the global annual mean for the last 50 years, and increase going back further in time reaching 0.15° C in 1880. In addition, we quantify the benefits and inherent uncertainty due to the GISTEMP interpolation and averaging method. We use the total uncertainties to estimate the probability for each record year in the GISTEMP to actually be the true record year (to that date), and conclude with 86% likelihood that 2016 was indeed the hottest year of the instrumental period (so far).",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

The recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer relies on the continued decline in the atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons1. The atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), the second-most abundant chlorofluorocarbon, has declined substantially since the mid-1990s. A recently reported slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 2012, however, suggests that global emissions have increased. A concurrent increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia contributes to the global emission increase, but the location and magnitude of this regional source are unknown. Here, using high-frequency atmospheric observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, together with global monitoring data and atmospheric chemical transport model simulations, we investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia. We show that emissions from eastern mainland China are 7.0 ± 3.0 (±1 standard deviation) gigagrams per year higher in 2014–2017 than in 2008–2012, and that the increase in emissions arises primarily around the northeastern provinces of Shandong and Hebei. This increase accounts for a substantial fraction (at least 40 to 60 per cent) of the global rise in CFC-11 emissions. We find no evidence for a significant increase in CFC-11 emissions from any other eastern Asian countries or other regions of the world where there are available data for the detection of regional emissions. The attribution of any remaining fraction of the global CFC-11 emission rise to other regions is limited by the sparsity of long-term measurements of sufficient frequency near potentially emissive regions. Several considerations suggest that the increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern mainland China is likely to be the result of new production and use, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global chlorofluorocarbon production by 2010.

**Abstract**

The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere. The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s. However, CFC-11 still contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations. Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13 ± 5 gigagrams per year (25 ± 13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

The Marine Isotope Stage 19c (MIS19c) interglaciation is regarded as the best orbital analog to the Holocene. The close of MIS19c (~777,000 years ago) thus serves as a proxy for a contemporary climate system unaffected by humans. Our global climate model simulation driven by orbital parameters and observed greenhouse gas concentrations at the end of MIS19c is 1.3 K colder than the reference pre-industrial climate of the late Holocene (year 1850). Much stronger cooling occurs in the Arctic, where sea ice and year-round snow cover expand considerably. Inferred regions of glaciation develop across northeastern Siberia, northwestern North America, and the Canadian Archipelago. These locations are consistent with evidence from past glacial inceptions and are favored by atmospheric circulation changes that reduce ablation of snow cover and increase accumulation of snowfall. Particularly large buildups of snow depth coincide with presumed glacial nucleation sites, including Baffin Island and the northeast Canadian Archipelago. These findings suggest that present-day climate would be susceptible to glacial inception if greenhouse gas concentrations were as low as they were at the end of MIS 19c.",Positive,Global stance

&gt;the risk of some unexpected catastrophic nonlinear effect shouldn't be ignored.

Absolutely right, I totally agree. I usually push back against discussion of methane removal like this because I hate seeing people treat it as directly exchangeable for huge quantities of CO2 when it's not that simple (as you've seen with that review paper).

,2019,5,Researchers outline vision for profitable climate change solution,"Thank you for the article. The sources I had read listed the CO2 atmospheric lifetime at ~100 years which is what I used in my analysis. It appears that it is actually better described by a multiexponential decay that includes a component with a lifetime that is effectively infinite. I suppose the actual time scale for this 'infinite' component is probably determined by the fossilization time scale. 

If I understand the logic of the article they are saying that every additional CO2 leads to a permanent increase in the global equilibrium temperature and that GHGs with finite lifetimes have only transient increases in equilibrium temperature. They are basically saying that time scale matters in your analysis. That seems pretty straightforward and unobjectionable to me. I don't think it completely changes my view on the importance of methane removal though because the time scales where its cumulative impact becomes less relevant than carbon is not insignificant and the risk of some unexpected catastrophic nonlinear effect shouldn't be ignored.  After reading a good chunk of the paper though (including the section on 'buying time'), I agree with their conclusion that methane abatement can't come at the cost of CO2 abatement.

I do have a follow up question though. From my understanding, the dominant source of natural methane removal in the atmosphere converts it to CO2 anyway so the argument seems kind of moot with respect to methane in the first place.

**Significance**

Future sea level rise (SLR) poses serious threats to the viability of coastal communities, but continues to be challenging to project using deterministic modeling approaches. Nonetheless, adaptation strategies urgently require quantification of future SLR uncertainties, particularly upper-end estimates. Structured expert judgement (SEJ) has proved a valuable approach for similar problems. Our findings, using SEJ, produce probability distributions with long upper tails that are influenced by interdependencies between processes and ice sheets. We find that a global total SLR exceeding 2 m by 2100 lies within the 90% uncertainty bounds for a high emission scenario. This is more than twice the upper value put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the Fifth Assessment Report.

**Abstract**

Despite considerable advances in process understanding, numerical modeling, and the observational record of ice sheet contributions to global mean sea-level rise (SLR) since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, severe limitations remain in the predictive capability of ice sheet models. As a consequence, the potential contributions of ice sheets remain the largest source of uncertainty in projecting future SLR. Here, we report the findings of a structured expert judgement study, using unique techniques for modeling correlations between inter- and intra-ice sheet processes and their tail dependences. We find that since the AR5, expert uncertainty has grown, in particular because of uncertain ice dynamic effects. For a +2 °C temperature scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement, we obtain a median estimate of a 26 cm SLR contribution by 2100, with a 95th percentile value of 81 cm. For a +5 °C temperature scenario more consistent with unchecked emissions growth, the corresponding values are 51 and 178 cm, respectively. Inclusion of thermal expansion and glacier contributions results in a global total SLR estimate that exceeds 2 m at the 95th percentile. Our findings support the use of scenarios of 21st century global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning purposes. Beyond 2100, uncertainty and projected SLR increase rapidly. The 95th percentile ice sheet contribution by 2200, for the +5 °C scenario, is 7.5 m as a result of instabilities coming into play in both West and East Antarctica. Introducing process correlations and tail dependences increases estimates by roughly 15%.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

Thanks in advance!!",2019,5,Guidance on research sources,"If you have the ppmv numbers (which are extremely easy to find; started at 280 ppmv, now we're at 415), you can easily just convert that directly to kg. 

The Earth's atmospheric pressure is about 100,000 Pa --&gt; 100,000 Newtons per m^2. 

You can get the mass of the atmosphere in a 1 m^2 column by dividing that number by g, the gravitational acceleration, which we'll take to be 10 m/s^2. So, 10^5 Pa/10 m/s^2 = 10^4 kg/m^2 of air. 

The average molar mass of the atmosphere is about 29 g/mol, so the number of moles of air (1 mole = 6.022x10^23 molecules) in an atmospheric column with a cross section of 1 m^2  is 10^4 kg/m^2 / (29x10^-3 kg/mol)  = ~3.4x10^5 moles/m^2.

280 ppmv stands for 280 parts per million by volume. Since the atmosphere behaves like an ideal gas, every mole of gas, no matter its identity, takes up the same volume at a given temperature and pressure. So, this is the same thing as saying that out of every million moles in the atmosphere, 280 of them used to be CO2. Now it's 415 for every million. 

So, to get the change in the number of moles of CO2 over a meter^2 of surface, we take (415 mole CO2/10^6 mole air - 280 mole CO2/10^6 mole air)*3.4x10^5 moles of air / m^2 = 46 moles CO2 per meter^2 = ~50 moles CO2 per meter^2 (rounding is fine here, this isn't a precise calculation).  

To get the change in mass of CO2 per m^2 since pre-industrial times, we multiply that number by CO2's molar mass, which is 44 x10^-3 kg/mole: 50 moles/m^2 * 44x10^-3 kg/mole = 2.2 kg CO2 / m^2.

Now to get the total mass of CO2 we've added to the atmosphere, we just multiply that number by the surface area of the earth: 2.2 kg/m^2 * (4pi*(6.371 x10^6 m)^2) = ~10^15 kg CO2 added to the atmosphere. That's a trillion metric tons added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. 

Often the ""safe level"" of CO2 is quoted as 350 ppmv, so you can use these numbers to figure out how many metric tons of CO2 we'd need to remove for ""safety."" Looks like it's roughly half a trillion metric tons. A metric shit-ton, you might say

"Hello! So I'm seriously considering changing careers to more directly help combat climate change. I'm somewhat overwhelmed trying to research all the options though. I'd love some help figuring out where I might be most helpful. 

My background: I studied molecular biology at a well respected university, spent a year in academia, in devopmental neurobiology (early nervous system development). I then left and started a social enterprise working in preventative mental health that's doing rather well. It's far from a unicorn, so I'm not loaded, but I've got credible entrepreneur credentials now. I'm not committed to leaving, but it's at the point where I could easily leave and the company would be fine.

Through that, I gained a good understanding of the literature around human behaviour change, albeit from a health and well-being perspective. I'm quite good at public speaking and talking about science (I used to tutor), but not at all experienced in debating.

I'm considering a few paths: 

* Science communication/journalism
* Going back to school for a masters that will set me on a relevant academic path. Biotech seems like a good compromise between potential impact and potential for transferable skills, but I'm very open to other options. Including more policy/behaviour change focused work. 
* Looking for a job with a promising climate start up that could use my help

Also open to left-field suggestions! Still very early in this process.",2019,5,Which are the most promising and/or most understaffed avenues for combating climate change?

It is generally accepted that animal heartbeat and lifespan are often inversely correlated, however, the relationship between productivity and longevity has not yet been described for trees growing under industrial and pre-industrial climates. Using 1768 annually resolved and absolutely dated ring width measurement series from living and dead conifers that grew in undisturbed, high-elevation sites in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Russian Altai over the past 2000 years, we test the hypothesis of grow fast—die young. We find maximum tree ages are significantly correlated with slow juvenile growth rates. We conclude, the interdependence between higher stem productivity, faster tree turnover, and shorter carbon residence time, reduces the capacity of forest ecosystems to store carbon under a climate warming-induced stimulation of tree growth at policy-relevant timescales.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Abstract**



The Laki eruption in Iceland, which began in June 1783, was followed by many of the typical climate responses to volcanic eruptions: suppressed precipitation and drought, crop failure, and surface cooling. In contrast to the observed cooling in 1784–1786, the summer of 1783 was anomalously warm in Western Europe, with July temperatures reaching more than 3 K above the mean. However, the winter of 1783–1784 in Europe was as cold as 3 K below the mean. While climate models generally reproduce the surface cooling and decreased rainfall associated with volcanic eruptions, model studies have failed to reproduce the extreme warming in western Europe that followed the Laki eruption. As a result of the inability to reproduce the anomalous warming, the question remains as to whether this phenomenon was a response to the eruption, or merely an example of internal climate variability. Using the Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, we investigate the “Laki haze” and its effect on Northern Hemisphere climate in the 12 months following the eruption onset. We find that the warm summer of 1783 was a result of atmospheric blocking over Northern Europe, that in our model cannot be attributed to the eruption. In addition, the extremely cold winter of 1783–1784 was aided by an increased likelihood of an El Niño after the eruption. Understanding the causes of these anomalies is important not only for historical purposes, but also for understanding and predicting possible climate responses to future high‐latitude volcanic eruptions.

Key Points

- The July 1783 heatwave in Western Europe was likely caused by anomalous circulation, and not caused by the Laki eruption.

- Africa and Asia faced large reductions in precipitation after the Laki eruption, which caused widespread drought and famine.

- The Laki eruption increased the likelihood of an El Niño in the subsequent boreal winter.",Negative,Global stance

____

**Abstract**



Fluctuations in Antarctic Ice Sheet elevation and mass occur over a variety of timescales, owing to changes in snowfall and ice flow. Here, we disentangle these signals by combining 25 years of satellite radar altimeter observations and a regional climate model. From these measurements, patterns of change that are strongly associated with glaciological events emerge. While the majority of the ice sheet has remained stable, 24% of West Antarctica is now in a state of dynamical imbalance. Thinning of the Pine Island and Thwaites glacier basins reaches 122 m in places, and their rates of ice loss are now five times greater than at the start of our survey. By partitioning elevation changes into areas of snow and ice variability, we estimate that East and West Antarctica have contributed ‐1.1±0.4 and +5.7±0.8 mm to global sea level between 1992 and 2017.

Key Points

- We combine satellite radar altimetry and a regional climate model to separate changes in Antarctic elevation into snow and ice contributions
  
- Between 1992 and 2017, ice thinning has grown in extent to include 24% of West Antarctica, and reaches 122 metres in places

Clouds are formed when aerosol act as kind of the glue to water vapor to condensate on (cloud condensation nuclei CCN). When we release more aerosol into the air than the atmosphere has in its natural state, that affects the cloud because it increases the number of CCN and how bright/long lived the cloud is. This effect is most prominent in low, warm clouds which are the most susceptible to changes in CCN. However, the amount aerosol affect the cloud is also moderated by the cloud state itself and the meteorology around the cloud. Rosenfeld has separated clouds in this study by the stability of the boundary layer (lower tropospheric stability LTS) and by the amount of water they contain (liquid water path LWP) to see how clouds in certain stabilities/with certain LWPs react to aerosol. They found unsurprisingly that some clouds are extremely susceptible while others are not. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are a number of environmental parameters that aren't accounted for in this study that can also affect how a cloud reacts to aerosol, such as how dry the atmosphere at certain heights. Also, even if the clouds are extremely susceptible to aerosol as Rosenfeld is saying, this doesn't mean that global warming is at a greater rate than we know. It means that the amount of warming is still highly uncertain, that if warming is being mitigated it may be by cloud feedbacks, and most importantly, that the error, uncertainty, and/or regional variances may explain the rate of warming more than the global average trends Rosenfeld suggests.",Positive,Global stance

These numbers might vary by some amounts depending on the model used but the answer to your question is definitely no (even if we went with the low estimate). 

However when we get to the point where all of that carbon is at risk of being released into the atmosphere the planet would already have warmed past any point of return.

Also that carbon is mostly as dead plant material and not straight up methane. When the permafrost melts it will start degrading into CO2 and CH4 due to microbial activity. 

In addition to that we have have large amounts of methane trapped in something called methane clathrates but most of those are so deep in sediments in the bottoms of the continental shelves that they aren't threatened by melting any time soon.

e: just to make it clear, SOME amounts of that 1300-1500pgs of carbon is already ""leaking"" into the atmosphere and the amount will keep increasing but we are talking about some gigatons or at most tens of gigatons during the next ~200 years or so.

My background: I studied molecular biology at a well respected university, spent a year in academia, in devopmental neurobiology (early nervous system development). I then left and started a social enterprise working in preventative mental health that's doing rather well. It's far from a unicorn, so I'm not loaded, but I've got credible entrepreneur credentials now. I'm not committed to leaving, but it's at the point where I could easily leave and the company would be fine.

Through that, I gained a good understanding of the literature around human behaviour change, albeit from a health and well-being perspective. I'm quite good at public speaking and talking about science (I used to tutor), but not at all experienced in debating.

I'm considering a few paths: 

* Science communication/journalism
* Going back to school for a masters that will set me on a relevant academic path. Biotech seems like a good compromise between potential impact and potential for transferable skills, but I'm very open to other options. Including more policy/behaviour change focused work. 
* Looking for a job with a promising climate start up that could use my help

It does indeed scale but instead of building one massive system I've taken to building multiple smaller, independent, towers. It runs off a toilet flush of water a week and my(rather large) goldfish go through a bucket of food every two years. 

I haven't tested it, because I love my fish too much to further experiment on them, but rain water should work in the system and, since it uses less electricity than my old light fixtures, it could easily be taken off grid entirely.

Use flat beds for plants that die out(kale, basil) and vertical ones for plants that seem to happily live forever (mints, watercress, chives, chamomile?)

and yes your impressions about this type of work's benefits to the environment are quite correct. A single person coupling an aquaponic system with an organic outdoor garden can offset hundreds, possibly thousands, of ignorant people.

Taking your systems off grid, and eating only what you could grow with an aquaponic system and organic gardening would reduce CO2 by 8.1 metric tons per person per year. For contrast a single person driving around for an entire year only creates 4.6 metric tons.

**Abstract**

The oil and gas (O&amp;G) sector represents a large source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. However, estimates of O&amp;G emissions rely upon bottom-up approaches, and are rarely evaluated through atmospheric measurements. Here, we use aircraft measurements over the Canadian oil sands (OS) to derive the first top-down, measurement-based determination of the their annual CO2 emissions and intensities. The results indicate that CO2 emission intensities for OS facilities are 13–123% larger than those estimated using publically available data. This leads to 64% higher annual GHG emissions from surface mining operations, and 30% higher overall OS GHG emissions (17 Mt) compared to that reported by industry, despite emissions reporting which uses the most up to date and recommended bottom-up approaches. Given the similarity in bottom-up reporting methods across the entire O&amp;G sector, these results suggest that O&amp;G CO2 emissions inventory data may be more uncertain than previously considered.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Plain Language Summary**

The World Heritage convention aims at protecting the Earth's outmost assets and commits humanity to transmit them to future generations. However, many World Heritage sites are affected by anthropogenic climate change. Here, we present the first study on the glaciers located within the natural World Heritage sites. We inventoried 19,000 World Heritage glaciers and projected their mass changes over the 21st century. The results emphasize that major glacier decline will occur in these iconic sites in future decades. Nevertheless, ice loss magnitude will vary by a factor of 2 according to CO2 emission scenarios and thus human activities. This study points out how the conservation of World Heritage glaciers could serve as a leverage and a target to tackle the unprecedented issue of climate change. Glaciers are more than disappearing passive climatic indicators. They are key components of planetary ecosystems that influence global climate and sea level, as well as water fluxes, human activities, or biodiversity at the regional scale. The conservation of these iconic endangered features could thus mobilize global‐scale conservation and climate mitigation benefits. In this context, we show how drastic reduction of emissions will rapidly curb melt rates and safeguard a large glacier volume on the long term.

**Abstract**

Since 1972, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Convention aims to identify and protect sites of Outstanding Universal Value for future generations. However, growing impacts of climate change are of the utmost concern for the integrity of many sites. Here, we inventory the glaciers present in natural World Heritage sites for the first time. We found 19,000 glaciers in 46 sites located all over the world. We analyze their recent evolution, current state, and project their mass change over the 21st century. Our results are based on a comprehensive review of the literature as well as a state‐of‐the‐art glaciological model for computing glacier responses up to 2100. Illustrating the strong influence of CO2 emission scenarios and human actions on future ice loss magnitude, we project the wastage of 33% to 60% of the 2017 cumulative ice volume of 12,000 km^3 of World Heritage glaciers by 2100.

**Abstract**

Although anthropogenic climate change is expected to have caused large shifts in temperature and rainfall, the detection of human influence on global drought has been complicated by large internal variability and the brevity of observational records. Here we address these challenges using reconstructions of the Palmer drought severity index obtained with data from tree rings that span the past millennium. We show that three distinct periods are identifiable in climate models, observations and reconstructions during the twentieth century. In recent decades (1981 to present), the signal of greenhouse gas forcing is present but not yet detectable at high confidence. Observations and reconstructions differ significantly from an expected pattern of greenhouse gas forcing around mid-century (1950–1975), coinciding with a global increase in aerosol forcing. In the first half of the century (1900–1949), however, a signal of greenhouse-gas-forced change is robustly detectable. Multiple observational datasets and reconstructions using data from tree rings confirm that human activities were probably affecting the worldwide risk of droughts as early as the beginning of the twentieth century.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

It's not a ""science"" sub, but on its face it's primarily aimed at the art of debunking nonsense.  UFOs, bigfoot, 9/11 Truth, etc.  Below the surface it tackles the arguments of cohesive movements behind ""anti-GMO"", ""anti-vaxx"", ""climate denial"", etc.  It occasionally goes full meta on the nature of skepticism itself, including random epistemological inquiries into the nature of knowledge and evidence.  It's ostensibly based on the concept of *scientific skepticism*, in that all beliefs must be supported by evidence and open to change when contrary evidence is provided, but its hands-off moderation style facilitates the seedy underbelly of Reddit conspiracy-sphere.  Because they're never reprimanded, much less de-platformed, pseudoskeptical contrarians like to frequent /r/skeptic to push whatever anti-science narrative it is they want to push.  Mainly because they know /r/skeptic has lots of users and is a good place to a) trigger liberals, b) win contrarian allies, or c) troll for the hell of it.  It's better for the committed trolls than /r/conspiracy because it's not so virulently insane and echo chamberish.  There is no shortage of arguments that can be started on /r/skeptic, so people go there to argue, because everyone there loves it.  Trolls are inevitably downvoted to hell because /r/skeptic has an undeniable left-lean, but they're never banned, so they stay for shits and giggles and to feel morally superior to users they believe are fake ""skeptics"".  What they *actually* want is to embrace cynical, partisan contrarianism, and they feel like if they push long enough they'll get to convince the hardcore ""skeptics"" that they're *actually* being ""unskeptical"".

At first glance /r/skeptic is a great idea, but with all great ideas comes great responsibility, and the moderation team is so profoundly wedded to the libertarian ideal of an unfettered free marketplace of ideas and so terrified of being accused of partisan censorship that they lay out a red carpet for the worst trolls of Reddit to get their rocks off however they see fit.

He trolls for months on end until his karma gets close to zero, at which point he spends a few weeks on /r/climateskeptics to beef it back up so he can return unhindered by comment timers or automod filters.  As far as I can tell he's the only one who never got bored and left.  Only two /r/climateskeptics users (that I know of) have ever been banned from /r/skeptic, and that's for using sockpuppet accounts.  The rest lose interest eventually and drift away.

____

**Summary**

Forest ecosystem methane (CH₄) research has focused on soils, but trees are also important sources and sinks in forest CH₄ budgets. Living and dead trees transport and emit CH₄ produced in soils; living trees and dead wood emit CH₄ produced inside trees by microorganisms; and trees produce CH₄ through an abiotic photochemical process. Here, we review the state of the science on the production, consumption, transport, and emission of CH₄ by living and dead trees, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of these processes across hydrologic gradients inclusive of wetland and upland ecosystems. Emerging research demonstrates that tree CH₄ emissions can significantly increase the source strength of wetland forests, and modestly decrease the sink strength of upland forests. Scaling from stem or leaf measurements to trees or forests is limited by knowledge of the mechanisms by which trees transport soil‐produced CH₄, microbial processes produce and oxidize CH₄ inside trees, a lack of mechanistic models, the diffuse nature of forest CH₄ fluxes, complex overlap between sources and sinks, and extreme variation across individuals. Understanding the complex processes that regulate CH₄ source–sink dynamics in trees and forests requires cross‐disciplinary research and new conceptual models that transcend the traditional binary classification of wetland vs upland forest.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Plain Language Summary**

The rise in atmospheric methane (CH₄), which began in 2007, accelerated in the past 4 years. The growth has been worldwide, especially in the tropics and northern midlatitudes. With the rise has come a shift in the carbon isotope ratio of the methane. The causes of the rise are not fully understood, and may include increased emissions and perhaps a decline in the destruction of methane in the air. Methane's increase since 2007 was not expected in future greenhouse gas scenarios compliant with the targets of the Paris Agreement, and if the increase continues at the same rates it may become very difficult to meet the Paris goals. There is now urgent need to reduce methane emissions, especially from the fossil fuel industry.


**Abstract**

Atmospheric methane grew very rapidly in 2014 (12.7 ± 0.5 ppb/year), 2015 (10.1 ± 0.7 ppb/year), 2016 (7.0 ± 0.7 ppb/year), and 2017 (7.7 ± 0.7 ppb/year), at rates not observed since the 1980s. The increase in the methane burden began in 2007, with the mean global mole fraction in remote surface background air rising from about 1,775 ppb in 2006 to 1,850 ppb in 2017. Simultaneously the ^(13)C/^(12)C isotopic ratio (expressed as δ^(13)C_CH₄) has shifted, has shifted, now trending negative for more than a decade. The causes of methane's recent mole fraction increase are therefore either a change in the relative proportions (and totals) of emissions from biogenic and thermogenic and pyrogenic sources, especially in the tropics and subtropics, or a decline in the atmospheric sink of methane, or both.

**Significance**

Climate models are foundational to formulations of climate policy and must successfully reproduce key features of the climate system. The temporal spectrum of observed global surface temperature is one such critical benchmark. This spectrum is known to obey scaling laws connecting astronomical forcings, from orbital to annual scales. We provide evidence that the current hierarchy of climate models is capable of reproducing the increase in variance in global-mean temperature at low frequencies. We suggest that successful climate predictions at decadal-to-centennial horizons hinge critically on the accuracy of initial and boundary conditions, particularly for the deep ocean state.

**Abstract**

Climate records exhibit scaling behavior with large exponents, resulting in larger fluctuations at longer timescales. It is unclear whether climate models are capable of simulating these fluctuations, which draws into question their ability to simulate such variability in the coming decades and centuries. Using the latest simulations and data syntheses, we find agreement for spectra derived from observations and models on timescales ranging from interannual to multimillennial. Our results confirm the existence of a scaling break between orbital and annual peaks, occurring around millennial periodicities. That both simple and comprehensive ocean–atmosphere models can reproduce these features suggests that long-range persistence is a consequence of the oceanic integration of both gradual and abrupt climate forcings. This result implies that Holocene low-frequency variability is partly a consequence of the climate system’s integrated memory of orbital forcing. We conclude that climate models appear to contain the essential physics to correctly simulate the spectral continuum of global-mean temperature; however, regional discrepancies remain unresolved. A critical element of successfully simulating suborbital climate variability involves, we hypothesize, initial conditions of the deep ocean state that are consistent with observations of the recent past.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Eastern Beringia is one of the few Western Arctic regions where full Holocene climate reconstructions are possible. However, most full Holocene reconstructions in Eastern Beringia are based either on pollen or midges, which show conflicting early Holocene summer temperature histories. This discrepancy precludes understanding the factors that drove past (and potentially future) climate change and calls for independent proxies to advance the debate. We present a ~13.6 ka summer temperature reconstruction in central Yukon, part of Eastern Beringia, using precipitation isotopes in syngenetic permafrost. The reconstruction shows that early Holocene summers were consistently warmer than the Holocene mean, as supported by midges, and a thermal maximum at ~7.6–6.6 ka BP. This maximum was followed by a ~6 ka cooling, and later abruptly reversed by industrial-era warming leading to a modern climate that is unprecedented in the Holocene context and exceeds the Holocene thermal maximum by +1.7 ± 0.7 °C.",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

Key observational indicators of climate change in the Arctic, most spanning a 47 year period (1971–2017) demonstrate fundamental changes among nine key elements of the Arctic system. We find that, coherent with increasing air temperature, there is an intensification of the hydrological cycle, evident from increases in humidity, precipitation, river discharge, glacier equilibrium line altitude and land ice wastage. Downward trends continue in sea ice thickness (and extent) and spring snow cover extent and duration, while near-surface permafrost continues to warm. Several of the climate indicators exhibit a significant statistical correlation with air temperature or precipitation, reinforcing the notion that increasing air temperatures and precipitation are drivers of major changes in various components of the Arctic system. To progress beyond a presentation of the Arctic physical climate changes, we find a correspondence between air temperature and biophysical indicators such as tundra biomass and identify numerous biophysical disruptions with cascading effects throughout the trophic levels. These include: increased delivery of organic matter and nutrients to Arctic near‐coastal zones; condensed flowering and pollination plant species periods; timing mismatch between plant flowering and pollinators; increased plant vulnerability to insect disturbance; increased shrub biomass; increased ignition of wildfires; increased growing season CO2 uptake, with counterbalancing increases in shoulder season and winter CO2 emissions; increased carbon cycling, regulated by local hydrology and permafrost thaw; conversion between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; and shifting animal distribution and demographics.

"Hi all,

Me and my SO are in the process of making a game set in a post-climate change world with the intent of guiding the player through the responsible development and use of technology to re-industrialize a dying society in a way which is mindful of, if not beneficial to, the environment.

We are crafting the base game play and scene aspects now, and are looking for resources to help us generate a quasi-realistic environment that will become the player's sandbox. To this end, we're interested in having an as-accurate-as-possible science-bassed depiction of post-climate change biodiversity &amp; abundance (at the level of taxa), climate, weather events, etc. For instance, at the game's start, we are assuming that the landscape is quite arid, human populations are sparse and clustered along coast lines with scarce water primarily coming from rudimentary desalintors, and taxa are mostly flies, birds (which seem to suffer the least impact from CC in general) and jellyfish (which from what I understand thrive in an acidified ocean). 

Here's a vague, non-exhaustive, list of things we are interested in (keep in mind that game-play elements will be a caricature of actual effects which would take centuries if not longer IRL):

* A picture of earth after 200-300 years of unchecked climate change, specifically in North America. What is the climate, how frequent are extreme weather events and related natural disasters, etc.
* The general effects of human activities such as farming and community expansion on surrounding ecologies at the per-taxa level if possible. As an exaggerated game-play element, after improving the local region's biodiversity by replanting forests, reintroducing native species, and improving farming conditions, how is the user punished for careless resource exploitation for profit?
* How atmospheric CO2 affects plant growth and farming for the purpose of caricature (e.g. deforestation and carbon use increase local CO2 -- survivable crops then develop more foliage, but not more nutrition, at the expense of high nitrogen consumption and increased water requirements)
* Loss of native plant species due to climate driven invasion, effective management strategies for invasive plants.
* Microbial biodiversity changes + effects up the food chain
* Climate driven effects on viral and bacterial epidemics in mammals, crops

&gt;The global atmospheric level of methane (CH4), the second most important greenhouse gas, is currently increasing by ∼10 million tons per year. Microbial oxidation in unsaturated soils is the only known biological process that removes CH4 from the atmosphere, but so far, bacteria that can grow on atmospheric CH4 have eluded all cultivation efforts. In this study, we have isolated a pure culture of a bacterium, strain MG08 that grows on air at atmospheric concentrations of CH4 [1.86 parts per million volume (p.p.m.v.)]. This organism, named Methylocapsa gorgona, is globally distributed in soils and closely related to uncultured members of the upland soil cluster α. CH4oxidation experiments and 13C-single cell isotope analyses demonstrated that it oxidizes atmospheric CH4 aerobically and assimilates carbon from both CH4 and CO2. Its estimated specific affinity for CH4 (a0s) is the highest for any cultivated methanotroph. However, growth on ambient air was also confirmed for Methylocapsa acidiphila and Methylocapsa aurea, close relatives with a lower specific affinity for CH4, suggesting that the ability to utilize atmospheric CH4 for growth is more widespread than previously believed. The closed genome of M. gorgonaMG08 encodes a single particulate methane monooxygenase, the serine cycle for assimilation of carbon from CH4 and CO2, and CO2 fixation via the recently postulated reductive glycine pathway. It also fixes dinitrogen and expresses the genes for a high-affinity hydrogenase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, suggesting that atmospheric CH4 oxidizers harvest additional energy from oxidation of the atmospheric trace gases carbon monoxide (0.2 p.p.m.v.) and hydrogen (0.5 p.p.m.v.).",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Variations in Earth’s orbit pace the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary, but the mechanisms that transform regional and seasonal variations in solar insolation into glacial-interglacial cycles are still elusive. Here, we present transient simulations of coevolution of climate, ice sheets, and carbon cycle over the past 3 million years. We show that a gradual lowering of atmospheric CO₂ and regolith removal are essential to reproduce the evolution of climate variability over the Quaternary. The long-term CO₂ decrease leads to the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and an increase in the amplitude of glacial-interglacial variations, while the combined effect of CO₂ decline and regolith removal controls the timing of the transition from a 41,000- to 100,000-year world. Our results suggest that the current CO₂ concentration is unprecedented over the past 3 million years and that global temperature never exceeded the preindustrial value by more than 2°C during the Quaternary.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

____

**Abstract**

Jakobshavn Isbrae has been the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay’s upper 250 m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavn’s future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.

____

**Abstract**

In climates with strongly seasonal rainfall, speleothem-based paleoclimate reconstructions are often thought to reflect wet season conditions, assuming a bias toward the season with greater water supply. This is particularly true in monsoon regions, where speleothem records are interpreted to document monsoon strength changes on multiple timescales. Dry season infiltration variability and rainfall seasonality are not typically considered in these reconstructions, even though cave ventilation could bias speleothem growth toward the cooler season. To investigate the influence of dry season infiltration on speleothem geochemistry, we combine a modern, sub-seasonally resolved trace element record from Mawmluh Cave in Northeast India with forward modeling experiments. We find that variations in the amplitude of seasonal signals in speleothem Mg/Ca, which reflects prior carbonate precipitation, are more sensitive to dry season rather than monsoon season infiltration. This sensitivity may be enhanced by dry season cave ventilation. The Mawmluh speleothem Mg/Ca record is consistent with increased dry season rainfall during the 1976–1998 warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation relative to 1964–2013. Our work demonstrates the importance of considering non-monsoon season rainfall when interpreting speleothem paleoclimate records and suggests that trace elements could provide insight into periods of enhanced dry season infiltration in monsoonal climates.",Positive,Weather extremes

___

**Abstract**

A recent compilation of methane plumes detected offshore Washington State includes 1,772 individual bubble streams issuing from 491 discrete vent sites. The majority of these plume sites form a narrow 10‐km‐wide band located shallower than 250‐m water depth, with most sites located near the 175‐m‐deep continental shelf break that tracks the head scarps of large submarine canyons. Archive multichannel seismic profiles over the Cascadia shelf and uppermost margin that were co‐located within a few hundred meters with active emission sites show that methane bubble streams arise from listric/normal faults and triangular‐shaped regions of disturbed seismic reflectors that intersect the seafloor and extend several kilometers into the subsurface. Geological processes were evaluated for producing the narrow emission site depths including nonuniform distribution of methane within the Cascadia accretionary sediment wedge and horizontal transfer of groundwater from onshore subaerial sources. A model of enhanced sediment permeability arising from a contrasting response between the inner and outer portions of the accretionary wedge deformation during a megathrust earthquake cycle appears the most likely mechanism. This faulting is generated during extension of the overriding plate during megathrust earthquake cycles, with semicontinuous permeability enhancement of the fluid pathways from excitation by contemporary incident seismic waves.

**Plain Language Summary**

Recognizing individual components of the global carbon cycle is critical to understand both past and present future climates. The sediments that accumulate on continental margins are an underappreciated part of this cycle, containing 40% of the oceanic reservoir of free carbon. Methane plumes issuing from the seafloor are an unquantified leakage of carbon from this giant reservoir. The current inventory of methane plumes on the northern Cascadia margin now approaches 500 emission sites, or an average of one a bubble emission site every 500 m. The majority of these methane emission sites are grouped within a north‐south band that follows the continental shelf edge and uppermost margin. The geological process for producing such a narrow band of emissions appears related to the megathrust earthquakes that occur episodically on the Cascadia Subduction Zone that underlies the Washington coast. During these earthquakes, the Juan de Fuca plate is thrust eastward beneath the overlying North American plate. The overlying plate that includes the Washington continental shelf extends rapidly westward during the fault motion. This rapid westward extension of the overlying plate produces faults and diapirs beneath the outer continental shelf, which become pathways for the methane fluid and gas from the margin sediments.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

___

**Significance**

Using 21st century climate model projections we show that for many crop-producing regions, average precipitation will change by more than the long-term natural variability, even under a low-emission scenario. However, emissions compatible with the Paris Agreement can significantly reduce cropped land affected. We identify the regions where adaptation measures are most needed.

**Abstract**

A warming climate will affect regional precipitation and hence food supply. However, only a few regions around the world are currently undergoing precipitation changes that can be attributed to climate change. Knowing when such changes are projected to emerge outside natural variability—the time of emergence (TOE)—is critical for taking effective adaptation measures. Using ensemble climate projections, we determine the TOE of regional precipitation changes globally and in particular for the growing areas of four major crops. We find relatively early (&lt;2040) emergence of precipitation trends for all four crops. Reduced (increased) precipitation trends encompass 1–14% (3–31%) of global production of maize, wheat, rice, and soybean. Comparing results for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 clearly shows that emissions compatible with the Paris Agreement result in far less cropped land experiencing novel climates. However, the existence of a TOE, even under the lowest emission scenario, and a small probability for early emergence emphasize the urgent need for adaptation measures. We also show how both the urgency of adaptation and the extent of mitigation vary geographically.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

We tested how sediment trapping by hydroelectric dams affects tropical estuaries by comparing two dammed and two undammed rivers on Mexico’s Pacific coast. We found that dams demonstrably affected the stability and productivity of the estuaries. The two rivers dammed for hydroelectricity had a rapid coastal recession (between 7.9 and 21.5 ha year−1) in what should otherwise be an accretional coastline. The economic consequences of this dam-induced coastal erosion include loss of habitat for fisheries, loss of coastal protection, release of carbon sequestered in coastal sediments, loss of biodiversity, and the decline of estuarine livelihoods. We estimate that the cost of the environmental damages a dam can cause in the lower part of basin almost doubles the purported benefits of emission reductions from hydroelectric generation.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Disentangling the relative importance of climate change abatement policies from the human–Earth system (HES) uncertainties that determine their performance is challenging because the two are inexorably linked, and the nature of this linkage is dynamic, interactive and metric specific. Here, we demonstrate an approach to quantify the individual and joint roles that diverse HES uncertainties and our choices in abatement policy play in determining future climate and economic conditions, as simulated by an improved version of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy. Despite wide-ranging HES uncertainties, the growth rate of global abatement (a societal choice) is the primary driver of long-term warming. It is not a question of whether we can limit warming but whether we choose to do so. Our results elucidate important long-term HES dynamics that are often masked by common time-aggregated metrics. Aggressive near-term abatement will be very costly and do little to impact near-term warming. Conversely, the warming that will be experienced by future generations will mostly be driven by earlier abatement actions. We quantify probabilistic abatement pathways to tolerable climate/economic outcomes, conditional on the climate sensitivity to the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Even under optimistic assumptions about the climate sensitivity, pathways to a tolerable climate/economic future are rapidly narrowing.",Positive,Undefined

Sorry for the rant.",2019,3,Republicans are pissing me off,"If you had read my previous comments, you would know that I don’t deny climate change and that I acknowledge the global increase in temperature. However, like many climate scientists, I question the extent to which human are attributable for rising temperature. In fact, the co-founder of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore and I share the same view on climate change. Yes, the Earth is warming, but how far are humans responsible for it? As previously outlined, there are a great many factors which influence temperature. One of the major groups of factors which change climate (as a NASA scientist would know) are astronomical variables. I am all for science, but scientifically this is by far the most important. Tilt of the earth, sun output, distance between earth and sun + other geological factors have to be accounted for. It would be (ironically) unscientific to point to one single cause of climate change because that would be inaccurate. Therefore, to a large extent, climate change is out of our hands. Of course, efforts can be made to stop what we can (ideas discussed down below) but ultimately we can’t control the course of nature and anyone who says otherwise is being unrealistic.

Despite having been provided with several links, I found no evidence to support your claim that the Earth would become uninhabitable. The Earth has been previously far warmer than today and man has survived through that. An increase in temperature would not send mankind into oblivion. As far as I know, even pro climate change scientists do not credit this idea. 

Here is what I think can be done to reduce our role in climate change. As I said in a previous comment, the US is reliant energy, 72% of which is generated using fossil fuels. Therefore, removing fossil fuels would significantly harm the economy and the country (and trade partners with the US) would crumble. *However efforts can be made to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. For example, if we regulate our electricity consumption, naturally, if less electricity is needed, less is going to be produced which means less harmful fuels get burnt. This idea of conservation is far more effective than eradicating coal/oil.*

**Abstract**

Solar geoengineering (SG) has the potential to restore average surface temperatures by increasing planetary albedo, but this could reduce precipitation. Thus, although SG might reduce globally aggregated risks, it may increase climate risks for some regions. Here, using the high-resolution forecast-oriented low ocean resolution (HiFLOR) model—which resolves tropical cyclones and has an improved representation of present-day precipitation extremes—alongside 12 models from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), we analyse the fraction of locations that see their local climate change exacerbated or moderated by SG. Rather than restoring temperatures, we assume that SG is applied to halve the warming produced by doubling CO₂ (half-SG). In HiFLOR, half-SG offsets most of the CO₂-induced increase of simulated tropical cyclone intensity. Moreover, neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-SG when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes (SREX) region. Indeed, for both extreme precipitation and water availability, less than 0.4% of the ice-free land surface sees exacerbation. Thus, while concerns about the inequality of solar geoengineering impacts are appropriate, the quantitative extent of inequality may be overstated.

The power of the atom, the heat of the sun and the steam stored deep in the Earth, the force of the winds and water must be main sources of energy for our grandchildren, and we can do it."" - Pres. Gerald Ford, 1974

Ten years ago I saw a documentary, ""Houston We Have A Problem"", at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival. Times have changed since then! US production of crude oil bottomed out in 2008, so the oilmen in the film have a fairly apocalyptic view of the future of oil. It would be interesting to see what they're doing now after the 150% increase in US oil production during the Obama years.

Or for example James Hackett of Anadarko Petroleum talks about what fuels are used for electricity production. Checking up on it now, US electricity has gone from 50% to 30% coal, 30% to 20% nuclear, 20% to 32% natural gas, and 9% to 17% renewables (which Hackett at 16:16 doesn't even mention).

When Ford made that quote in 1974, right after the Arab Oil Embargo was ended, Republicans believed energy independence was a number one priority for the US, but a Democratic majority in Congress didn't follow Ford's lead. Because of the Embargo, some things were done, like the 55 mph speed limit and other energy saving measures, but they didn't really get behind a push for renewables.

The Ford quote is at 29:23. There's another good quote at 1:17:54 - ""The Stone Age did not end for the lack of rocks. The Oil Age will not end for the lack of oil.""

Sorry for the rant.",2019,3,Republicans are pissing me off,"&gt; Of those factors, as you said, human output and influence on the climate is quite small 

This isn't true. Humans are burning about 3.5 cubic miles of oil equivalent per year, putting about 37 billion metric tons of new CO2 into the atmosphere each year. This is enough to increase atmospheric CO2 by about 5 ppm each year, but around half of it is absorbed by the oceans, where it reduces the alkalinity of seawater. That leaves enough to increase CO2 levels by about 2.5ppm, which is in fact the measured increase. This amount of CO2 is about 200 times what volcanoes currently emit.

The main problem with dismissal of global warming because Earth has always gone through changes, is that it ignores the fact that all those changes happen for reasons. Temperature doesn't just go up and down for no reason. 

Before the Carboniferous there was ten times as much CO2 in the atmosphere as now, because that was how the Earth started. Average temperatures were about 15C (~30F) warmer than today. During the Carboniferous, plants removed CO2 from the atmosphere and over time the plants were buried and became coal deposits. CO2 levels came down and average temperatures became close to what they are today.

At the end of the Permian, volcano fields in what is now Siberia sprung up through some of those Carboniferous coal deposits, burning the coal and releasing CO2 into the atmosphere again. This lead to the Permian-Triassic Extinction that killed most animal life on Earth.

What we're doing now is not as extreme as that, but the principle is the same.There was a reason why temperatures rose at the end of the Permian, and it's the same reason why temperatures are rising now. And the same goes for ocean acidification, which is part of what killed off 97% of ocean life during the Permian-Triassic Extinction.

We acknowledge that the climate is constantly in flux and that there are a great many factors, most of which are astronomical and geological when it comes to the climate. Of those factors, as you said, human output and influence on the climate is quite small which is why many conservatives don’t see the point in trying to halt natural changes which often comes at an economical cost. Take the Green New Deal which has recently been proposed by AOC. It calls for America to sustain all energy on purely 100% renewable energy, an unreachable target which would drastically hurt the American economy.

The reason why many conservatives are against climate action plans is because there is often a greater economic and political cost at hand, which is not worth going through compared to the practical results which these plans are going to give.

How would you contextualize old predictions in terms of modern research, and how would you characterize UN involvement?","I think it’s important to contextualize such predictions with other documents generated at the time, as well as considering the sorts of predictions which were being made.  [The IPCC’s AR1 report, Chapter 6](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_06.pdf) was published just a year later in 1990, and the predictions they give for temperature change over the next century are dependent on climate sensitivity figures and emissions scenarios.  Their Business as Usual scenario, for instance, was a 1% per-annum increase in CO2, which is actually very high compared to what has actually been happening, roughly 0.5% per annum.  Even then, their predictions are not extremely dire.  What did happen should be compared to the scenario which best matches reality, not compared to what they suggested could be a worst case *emissions* scenario.  If predictions of doomsday were made back then based on unrealistic projections of the inputs to the model, then that’s hardly a claim against the model.

We didn’t have the types of modeling capabilities back then as we do now, too.  So if certain predictions have changed dramatically with time, it’s fair to view those in light of advancements in computing power and parameterization, first.

What was concerning back then was that there were some important sources of uncertainty: we didn’t have a great idea what climate sensitivity could be, we didn’t know how much we would emit, and we didn’t know how certain gases like CFCs would change (the Montreal Protocol had only just been passed).  Uncertainty about whether the outcome will be disastrous or just bad does not beget surety to stay the course, IMO.  Regardless, what better answers we have now to those questions are still not at all reassuring.  Climate change deniers will point to concern at a time of higher uncertainty as evidence that we should not listen to concern at a time of lower uncertainty.

Not a troll just trying to understand how the mechanics of that would work in the context of the scientific model. ",2019,3,Can someone explain these this climate science item to me?,"Great follow up. As I previously stated (then from memory), more than one variable controls the Earth's temperature.


The main variables are the concentration of greenhouse gases, as well as the amount of heat the Earth receives from the sun which is also not constant, but varies more slowly than greenhouse gases.


Since the Ordovician (over 400 million years ago), the amount of heat the Earth has received from the sun has steadily declined. The decline has been VERY slow compared to human time scales and the change is almost non-existent over the last few million years. CO2 varies more quickly even on the 100,000 year timescale and anthropogenic CO2 of course changes on the 100 year and 10 year timescales.


In the Ordovician, with less solar heat, the amount of CO2 required to melt all glaciers was multiple thousands of parts-per-million. They could have tons of CO2 and not be nearly as warm.


Currently, and for the last 100 million years, the amount of CO2 required to melt glaciers is much lower than 400 million years ago, because the Earth is now receiving more heat from the sun.


So we are currently at over 400 ppm CO2 and before the industrial age it was 280 ppm. At the rate we're going we can easily pass 600 ppm or even go to 1000 ppm on human time scales, and the resulting climate would be quite different than any experienced by man and could exceed CO2 values the Earth has experienced for 10's of millions of years.


For time reference, we split from chimps about 5 million years ago and anatomically modern humans might have existed for about 300,000 years.


When you combine this CO2 level, way higher than man has experienced, with our higher solar heat variable, you get a very hot planet. Not the hottest the Earth has ever been but hotter than we've ever seen by a long shot. This comes with coastal flooding, more rainfall, ocean acidification and other effects.


I live in Houston where hurricanes like Hurricane Harvey will likely occur much more often now.


You linked to one article which gets into the details of the carbon cycle and how it might have differed due to chemical weathering processes hundreds of millions of years ago. This stuff is not yet fully explained but it does seem like during the Ordovician, the carbon cycle was quite different (on top of the solar changes) and the correlation between CO2 and temperature was less strong. In any case, the farther back in time you go, the weirder stuff gets and the more different Earth is from today.


We can say with much higher certainty that CO2 has definitely been the primary driver of temperature for at least the last 800,000 years for which we have ice cores. The farther back you go the more you need various isotopes and proxies to infer global temperatures and CO2 values.


Here are some cool links:

Another potential issue is that they start from modern CO2 and double from there, instead of starting from pre-industrial.  Since climate sensitivity is state dependent, that could change their answer somewhat (although I think it would be a small difference since the starting points wouldn't be all that different).

Take a look at specific predictions made that would apply to the present day:

&gt;The most conservative scientific estimate that the Earth’s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years, said Brown.

Given that this is in Farhenheit (since it's an American piece from the 80s), it turns out that was correct - [temps rose about 1 degree F (0.6 degrees C) over the following 30 years](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1989/mean:12).

&gt;He said even the most conservative scientists ″already tell us there’s nothing we can do now to stop a ... change″ of about 3 degrees.

This is consistent with what scientists are saying now, too - [the big effort now is to keep temperatures from rising much more than 1.5 degrees C](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-limit-degrees-ipcc-climate-change) (roughly 3 degrees F) by the year 2100, because that amount of warming is basically inevitable.

As they have with the recent ""12 years"" figure, the ""skeptics"" confuse the time frame over which we have to act in order to prevent future warming, versus the time frame over which that warming will occur.

As Pohl et al. allude to, it's not a satisfactory explanation by itself for how we could transition into a snowball Earth—you need something to change, and while a stable climate in a Faint Sun scenario may have high CO2, you need one of them to change to cause snowball Earth, and the Sun takes far too long compared to the geological history of the Ordovician glaciation.  They say:

&gt; Fainter Sun (Gough, 1981) somewhat reduces this apparent
discrepancy between high CO2 levels and glacial inception
by suggesting that the solar constant was lower in the past.
Nevertheless, it seems insufficient; the best hypotheses today
consider a Late Ordovician drop in CO2 to be the trigger of
glaciation (Brenchley et al., 1994; Kump et al., 1999; Villas
et al., 2002; Lenton et al., 2012).

[This paper, Bahcall et al. 2001](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0010346.pdf), suggests that around when the Ordovician was (some ~ 450 MYA), solar luminosity (energy emitted per unit time) was roughly 4% lower than today (their Table 2).  That translates to some 54 W/m^2 less sunlight at the top of our atmosphere, which is very substantial.  (In terms of radiative forcing, average energy per unit area onto the planet's surface, you divide by 4—because only a quarter of the Earth's surface ever faces the Sun—and multiply by 1 - A, where A is the albedo; so it may be something like 8-11 W/m^(2) radiative forcing.  Contrast this to an estimated 3.7 W/m^(2) radiative forcing change per doubling of CO2.)

It's so large in fact that [some research has been done to solve the apparent ""Faint Sun"" paradox](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2011RG000375), where the Sun is so weak in the far past, according to standard stellar evolution models, that very strong greenhouse effects are needed to explain why there was even liquid water for such an extended period of time.",Positive,Undefined

,2019,3,"GCMs have systematically over-estimated the strength of a negative cloud-phase feedback, which implies that we are facing a considerably higher climate sensitivity to CO2 (possibly around 5.5 C per CO2 doubling) than past studies have led us to believe","summary:

Basically, many clouds in the upper atmosphere are mixed phase, meaning they consist of a mixture of supercooled liquid droplets and solid ice particles. As the climate warms, the proportion of water within clouds shifts toward liquid droplets because the ice melts. The liquid droplets are smaller and more reflective, so, as the climate warms, the shift in mixed phase partitioning increases earth's albedo and counteracts some of the greenhouse warming by reflecting away more sunlight. Yay, a negative feedback. Now, the interesting bit of the paper, however, is that most climate models have been greatly over-representing that effect. they basically assumed that the clouds started off with a much larger proportion of ice particles than recent satellite observations indicate, which means that they greatly over-represented this increase in cloud albedo with warming (since in reality, according to observations, there isn't all that much ice to melt in the clouds to make them more reflective), which means they UNDER-represented climate sensitivity to a given amount of CO2 forcing. With more accurate representations of this cloud effect, the temperature change per CO2 doubling is closer to the range of 5-6 C (as opposed to the 2-4 that most models produce currently).",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

The short answer is yes, meteorologists are still able to forecast regardless of climate change.

Weather forecasts consider current atmospheric conditions to predict what will happen next. The models are an incredibly valuable tool, but we also use satellite, radar, MOS data, weather station data, and information collected from weather balloons to determine what the weather will be like in a few hours, tomorrow, a few days, and next week.  

Climate change, while very real and deeply alarming, isn't necessarily preventing meteorologists from figuring out what the atmosphere is going to do. For example, climate change is causing hurricanes to slow in speed, which is increasing the flooding associated with these storms. A forecaster (as well as models) will still base their prediction off the current trends of the atmosphere and the observed behavior and data collected from that particular storm.

",2019,3,Can someone explain these this climate science item to me?,"The important thing to keep in mind is that the warming effect of CO2 is documented, testable, and as historic as Darwin’s “On The Origin of Species”.  We know that it causes warming by physics.  We further have very substantial pieces of evidence, with for instance the close track of CO2 and temperature in ice cores over the past several hundred thousand years (with CO2 leading temperature changes globally, mind you, despite the appearance of a lag the other way around when only looking at southern cores), or also the cause of the PETM, which prove that CO2 causes global warming.

Peculiarities of certain snowball Earth episodes do not present evidence against physics, they only highlight how there can be more factors at play.  You may have your datasets mixed up a bit, but there have certainly been times when there was high CO2 and extensive sea ice or ice sheets.  The late Ordovician is a good example of where several other factors would be at play.  For instance, the Sun at that time was at a younger stage in its life, and had lower total irradiance.  Also, the continental arrangement was different, and that impacts ocean heat transport poleward, and impacts sensitivity of that transport to other factors.  Some more recent ocean modeling attempts like [Pohl et al. (2014)](https://www.clim-past.net/10/2053/2014/cp-10-2053-2014.pdf) try to investigate the possibility that with that arrangement, there may be a “tipping point” where glaciation starts at a higher CO2 concentration than we may otherwise expect.

Furthermore, the CO2 record during the late Ordovician nonetheless matches our general understanding of causality, namely that when CO2 was drawn down, glaciation followed, and then when CO2 increased following the covering of silicate rocks by ice (preventing erosion by CO2), deglaciation followed.  [Young et al. (2010)](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/f/94/files/2014/05/youngetal_2010-1j65zq1.pdf) document that.",Positive,Undefined

Not a troll just trying to understand how the mechanics of that would work in the context of the scientific model. ",2019,3,Can someone explain these this climate science item to me?,"As others have said, there’s a few things here that are almost right.

First, CO2 is one of multiple temperature drivers but it has been the most prominent driver the last few million years.

Second, if you go back in time far enough, there were times of anomalously high CO2 and still had some glaciers. So the fact that the correlation between temperature and CO2 breaks down if you go far enough back, is seen as evidence of multiple climate trends super-imposed on each other.

Third, as others have mentioned I think the time when CO2 was high and there were glaciers was pre-Cretaceous (&gt;100 million years ago) but I’m going from memory here. The Cretaceous certainly had high CO2 but it was warm, as you’d expect.

So even knowing that there are other controls on global temperature the argument for anthropogenic C02 emissions being the dominant driver now is pretty straightforward. The logic can be broken down to 4 ideas:

1. We know C02 has been increasing the last few hundred years.

2. We know temperature has been increasing the last few hundred years, closely mirroring the C02 increase.

3. We know how greenhouse gases can cause temperature rise, thus explaining the very tight correlation between temperature and C02 trends, i.e. we can infer with high confidence that the recent temperature rise is due to C02. It’s probably causation not just correlation because the causal mechanism is well understand (that greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere).

4. We know that the primary source of C02 into the atmosphere the past few hundred years is due to human activity. We released millions of years of carbon captured by organic matter (marine plankton, in the case of oil) and released it in 200 years so that’s VERY fast for the carbon cycle.

To reject anthropogenic climate change, you’d have to take issue with at least one of those 4 points but all 4 points are pretty straightforward and verifiable. We can find some sources if you want details on any of those points.

The interesting conversation to me is what to do about it. I think the case could be made that it’s cheaper to adapt than to try to stop it since we’ll likely blow past the 2 degree Celsius threshold. In any case, it does not make sense to deny it or do nothing but there is a real debate about what is the best path forward once you accept climate change.

Notably, even if you reject anthropogenic climate change it would STILL make sense to proactively adapt to a changing climate and prepare rather than do nothing.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

This study explores the extent to which convective aggregation interacts with sea surface temperature (SST) and affects climate sensitivity. For this purpose, radiative‐convective equilibrium simulations are run with a general circulation model coupled to an ocean mixed layer, and several types of perturbations are imposed to the ocean‐atmosphere system. Convective aggregation turns out to be much more sensitive to temperature in coupled experiments than in prescribed SST experiments. But changes in convective aggregation induced by a doubling of the CO2 concentration are always smaller than changes associated with the transition from a non‐aggregated to an aggregated state. If aggregation changes were acting alone, they would exert a strong negative feedback on global mean surface temperature. However, in a coupled framework, aggregation changes interact with the SST and generate SST gradients that strengthen the positive low‐cloud feedback associated with changes in SST pattern. This overcompensates the negative feedback due to aggregation changes and leads to a larger equilibrium climate sensitivity than in the absence of SST gradients. Although this effect might be model specific, interactions between convective aggregation and the spatial distribution of SST appear crucial to assess the impact of convective aggregation on climate sensitivity.",Negative,Global stance

**Significance**

North Pacific jet stream (NPJ) behavior strongly affects cool-season moisture delivery in California and is an important predictor of summer fire conditions. Reconstructions of the NPJ before modern fire suppression began in the early 20th century identify the relationships between NPJ characteristics and precipitation and fire extremes. After fire suppression, the relationship between the NPJ and precipitation extremes is unchanged, but the NPJ–fire extremes relationship breaks down. Simulations with high CO2 forcing show higher temperatures, reduced snowpack, and drier summers by 2070 to 2100 whether overall precipitation is enhanced or reduced, thereby overriding historical dynamic NPJ precursor conditions and increasing fire potential due to thermodynamic warming. Recent California fires during wet extremes may be early evidence of this change.

**Abstract**

Moisture delivery in California is largely regulated by the strength and position of the North Pacific jet stream (NPJ), winter high-altitude winds that influence regional hydroclimate and forest fire during the following warm season. We use climate model simulations and paleoclimate data to reconstruct winter NPJ characteristics back to 1571 CE to identify the influence of NPJ behavior on moisture and forest fire extremes in California before and during the more recent period of fire suppression. Maximum zonal NPJ velocity is lower and northward shifted and has a larger latitudinal spread during presuppression dry and high-fire extremes. Conversely, maximum zonal NPJ is higher and southward shifted, with narrower latitudinal spread during wet and low-fire extremes. These NPJ, precipitation, and fire associations hold across pre–20th-century socioecological fire regimes, including Native American burning, postcontact disruption and native population decline, and intensification of forest use during the later 19th century. Precipitation extremes and NPJ behavior remain linked in the 20th and 21st centuries, but fire extremes become uncoupled due to fire suppression after 1900. Simulated future conditions in California include more wet-season moisture as rain (and less as snow), a longer fire season, and higher temperatures, leading to drier fire-season conditions independent of 21st-century precipitation changes. Assuming continuation of current fire management practices, thermodynamic warming is expected to override the dynamical influence of the NPJ on climate–fire relationships controlling fire extremes in California. Recent widespread fires in California in association with wet extremes may be early evidence of this change.",Positive,Global stance

1) Marine stratocumulus are not a tropical cloud type per say. They occur off the western coasts of the major continents and are driven by the cold upwelling waters and subsidence of the free atmosphere. The author seems to assume that the location they occur in wouldn't be affected by the change in SST, when if the SST was increasing, the region they would form would shift towards the colder waters. 

2) SST patterns, which drive the formation of mSc and eventual mSc to CU transition, weren't accounted for and remain uncertain. 

3) The mSc to CU transition is affected by more than just the local radiative balance. These clouds have turbulence driven by cloud top cooling, however the break up process is more complex than a decrease in turbulence. 

4) All other effects like aerosol or the water vapor feedback were glossed over. The author assumes that the relative humidity of the entire atmosphere will follow the \~7%/K increase that CC estimates, which has never been proven from observations to be the case. Instead, it is much more likely that individual levels on a regional basis will be more affected by a water vapor feedback, meaning the free atmospheric relative humidity may remain unchanged in subsiding regions above mSc.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Negative carbon emission technologies are critical for ensuring a future stable climate. However, the gaseous state of CO2 does render the indefinite storage of this greenhouse gas challenging. Herein, we created a liquid metal electrocatalyst that contains metallic elemental cerium nanoparticles, which facilitates the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to layered solid carbonaceous species, at a low onset potential of −310 mV vs CO2/C. We exploited the formation of a cerium oxide catalyst at the liquid metal/electrolyte interface, which together with cerium nanoparticles, promoted the room temperature reduction of CO2. Due to the inhibition of van der Waals adhesion at the liquid interface, the electrode was remarkably resistant to deactivation via coking caused by solid carbonaceous species. The as-produced solid carbonaceous materials could be utilised for the fabrication of high-performance capacitor electrodes. Overall, this liquid metal enabled electrocatalytic process at room temperature may result in a viable negative emission technology.",Negative,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**



This paper investigates the problem of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of Dynamical Earth System Models and proposes a basis for how such analyses should be performed. We argue that (a) performance metric‐based approaches to parameter GSA are actually identifiability analyses, (b) the use of a performance metric to assess sensitivity unavoidably distorts the information provided by the model about relative parameter importance, and (c) it is a serious conceptual flaw to interpret the results of such an analysis as being consistent and accurate indications of the sensitivity of the model response to parameter perturbations. Further, because such approaches depend on availability of system state/output observational data, the analysis they provide is necessarily incomplete. Here we frame the GSA problem from first principles, using trajectories of the partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to controlling factors as the theoretical basis for sensitivity, and construct a global sensitivity matrix from which statistical indices of total period time‐aggregate parameter importance, and time series of time‐varying parameter importance, can be inferred. We demonstrate this framework using the HBV‐SASK conceptual hydrologic model applied to the Oldman basin in Canada and show that it disagrees with performance metric‐based methods regarding which parameters exert the strongest controls on model behavior. Further, it is highly efficient, requiring less than 1,000 base samples to obtain stable and robust parameter importance assessments for our 10‐parameter example.

**Plain Language Summary**

When developing and using computer‐based models to (a) understand Earth and environmental systems, (b) make predictions, and/or (c) make management or policy decisions, it is very important to know which factors most strongly control the behaviors of the model. Tools to determine this are called sensitivity analysis (SA) methods. This paper shows that the use of model performance metrics to assess sensitivity is based in faulty reasoning. By framing the problem from first principles, a logical approach is developed that provides accurate and cost‐effective assessments of both time‐aggregate and time‐varying parameter importance. Because the approach does not require availability of system output data, it enables a comprehensive assessment and can be applied to historical and predictive conditions, as well as to future scenarios.",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Stratocumulus clouds cover 20% of the low-latitude oceans and are especially prevalent in the subtropics. They cool the Earth by shading large portions of its surface from sunlight. However, as their dynamical scales are too small to be resolvable in global climate models, predictions of their response to greenhouse warming have remained uncertain. Here we report how stratocumulus decks respond to greenhouse warming in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics in a representative subtropical region. In the simulations, stratocumulus decks become unstable and break up into scattered clouds when CO2 levels rise above 1,200 ppm. In addition to the warming from rising CO2 levels, this instability triggers a surface warming of about 8 K globally and 10 K in the subtropics. Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once CO2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred. Climate transitions that arise from this instability may have contributed importantly to hothouse climates and abrupt climate changes in the geological past. Such transitions to a much warmer climate may also occur in the future if CO2 levels continue to rise.

Frank Luntz is a conservative political consultant that put out a memo detailing a strategy to improve conservative arguments about the environment by tempering the severity of the issue and furthering the debate. [Here is an article discussing the memo](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange) and [here is the memo.](https://web.archive.org/web/20040203162027/http://www.ewg.org/briefings/luntzmemo/pdf/LuntzResearch_environment.pdf)  He proposed using ""climate change"" instead of the term ""global warming"" because it sounded less frightening, and to emphasize a lack of consensus in the scientific community.  He also casts doubt on the ability of government to regulate and fund a solution to global warming, while also claiming that the US was doing more to reduce pollution than other nations so we were not to take any blame nor responsibility.  

 [There are differing opinions](https://nigguraths.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/the-story-of-the-frank-luntz-memo/) on the purpose of his memo and subsequently how its message was used and perceived by both political parties, so it's important to read it and gain your own understanding of its content.

**Abstract**

Black carbon (BC) contributes to Arctic climate warming, yet source attributions are inaccurate due to lacking observational constraints and uncertainties in emission inventories. Year-round, isotope-constrained observations reveal strong seasonal variations in BC sources with a consistent and synchronous pattern at all Arctic sites. These sources were dominated by emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the winter and by biomass burning in the summer. The annual mean source of BC to the circum-Arctic was 39 ± 10% from biomass burning. Comparison of transport-model predictions with the observations showed good agreement for BC concentrations, with larger discrepancies for (fossil/biomass burning) sources. The accuracy of simulated BC concentration, but not of origin, points to misallocations of emissions in the emission inventories. The consistency in seasonal source contributions of BC throughout the Arctic provides strong justification for targeted emission reductions to limit the impact of BC on climate warming in the Arctic and beyond.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

A quarter of our yearly CO2 emissions, it says, are taken up by the terrestrial biospheres. They are talking about possibly some of that not taken up any more in a warming world.

But it is an early study, it could go the other way as they go to more detailed studies. They say that they are now looking at how well their model maps the tropics.

Though they don't mention it, I've also seen articles suggesting that as the Siberian and Canadian permafrost melt - it could lead to more release of methane, but it could also lead to more uptake of CO2, for instance in peatlands studied in northern Canada, then permafrost that melted after forest fires showed a net uptake of carbon due to peat formation, and less CO2 and methane was released than expected. So it is hard to model, and in some cases it can even be carbon negative.

Since the forcing is proportional to the logarithmic concentration, successive doublings of atmospheric CO2 impose a similar climate forcing.

**Abstract**

A major challenge in articulating human dimensions of climate change lies in translating global climate forecasts into impact assessments that are intuitive to the public. Climate-analog mapping involves matching the expected future climate at a location (e.g., a person’s city of residence) with current climate of another, potentially familiar, location - thereby providing a more relatable, place-based assessment of climate change. For 540 North American urban areas, we used climate-analog mapping to identify the location that has a contemporary climate most similar to each urban area’s expected 2080’s climate. We show that climate of most urban areas will shift considerably and become either more akin to contemporary climates hundreds of kilometers away and mainly to the south or will have no modern equivalent. Combined with an interactive web application, we provide an intuitive means of raising public awareness of the implications of climate change for 250 million urban residents.",Positive,Global stance

,2019,2,Satellite Observations Validate Stratosphere Temperature Models,"Here is the plain language summary of the paper the article writes about:

&gt;A previous analysis by Thompson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) showed substantial differences between satellite‐observed and model‐simulated stratospheric cooling trends since the late 1970s. Here we compare recently revised and extended satellite temperature records with new simulations from 14 chemistry‐climate models. The results show much better agreement in the magnitude of stratospheric cooling over 1979–2005 between models and observations. This cooling was predominantly driven by increasing greenhouse gases and declining stratospheric ozone levels. An extended satellite temperature record and the chemistry‐climate models show weaker global stratospheric cooling over 1998–2016 compared to 1979–1997. This is due to the reduction in ozone‐induced cooling from the slowdown of ozone trends and the onset of ozone recovery since the late 1990s. There are larger differences in the latitudinal structure of past stratospheric temperature trends due to the effects of unforced atmospheric variability. In summary, the results show much better consistency between simulated and satellite‐observed stratospheric temperature trends than was reported by Thompson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) for the previous versions of the satellite record and last generation of chemistry‐climate models. The improved agreement mainly comes from updates to the satellite records, while the range of simulated trends is comparable to the previous generation of models.

The article is a simple explanation of the new analysis that shows stratospheric temperature trends are in agreement with the climate models. I understand that this has been a somewhat difficult task due to the limited amount of data on the stratosphere as a whole, so it is good to see progress in this area. This is also one of the observational measurements I point to when talking to people who believe climate change science is all models or to people who believe the warming is natural. This is a real effect that is happening; the cooling in the stratosphere is dependent on a large amount of warming in the troposphere due to an increase in greenhouse gases. From the conclusion of the paper:

&gt; CCMI experiments designed to separate the effects of changes in atmospheric ODSs and other long‐lived greenhouse gases indicate that GHGs made a dominant contribution to global stratospheric temperature trends over 1998–2016, while both ODSs (via their effect on ozone) and GHGs made comparable contributions to cooling near 1 hPa over 1979–1997 and ODSs dominated the lower stratospheric cooling trend prior to 1997.
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, chemistry‐climate models forced with observed changes in GHGs and ODSs, and which include other drivers of stratospheric temperature variability (e.g., solar variability), simulate long‐term stratospheric temperature trends since 1979 that are in good quantitative agreement with updated and extended satellite temperature records both globally and in their latitudinal structure. ...",Positive,Undefined

**Abstract**

Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of the world’s glaciers is a fundamental prerequisite for a range of studies. Projections of future glacier change, estimates of the available freshwater resources or assessments of potential sea-level rise all need glacier ice thickness to be accurately constrained. Previous estimates of global glacier volumes are mostly based on scaling relations between glacier area and volume, and only one study provides global-scale information on the ice thickness distribution of individual glaciers. Here we use an ensemble of up to five models to provide a consensus estimate for the ice thickness distribution of all the about 215,000 glaciers outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The models use principles of ice flow dynamics to invert for ice thickness from surface characteristics. We find a total volume of 158 ± 41 × 10^(3) km^(3), which is equivalent to 0.32 ± 0.08 m of sea-level change when the fraction of ice located below present-day sea level (roughly 15%) is subtracted. Our results indicate that High Mountain Asia hosts about 27% less glacier ice than previously suggested, and imply that the timing by which the region is expected to lose half of its present-day glacier area has to be moved forward by about one decade.",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

Tropical cyclones that rapidly intensify are typically associated with the highest forecast errors and cause a disproportionate amount of human and financial losses. Therefore, it is crucial to understand if, and why, there are observed upward trends in tropical cyclone intensification rates. Here, we utilize two observational datasets to calculate 24-hour wind speed changes over the period 1982–2009. We compare the observed trends to natural variability in bias-corrected, high-resolution, global coupled model experiments that accurately simulate the climatological distribution of tropical cyclone intensification. Both observed datasets show significant increases in tropical cyclone intensification rates in the Atlantic basin that are highly unusual compared to model-based estimates of internal climate variations. Our results suggest a detectable increase of Atlantic intensification rates with a positive contribution from anthropogenic forcing and reveal a need for more reliable data before detecting a robust trend at the global scale.

**Abstract**

Ice provides a range of ecosystem services—including fish harvest, cultural traditions, transportation, recreation and regulation of the hydrological cycle—to more than half of the world’s 117 million lakes. One of the earliest observed impacts of climatic warming has been the loss of freshwater ice, with corresponding climatic and ecological consequences. However, while trends in ice cover phenology have been widely documented, a comprehensive large-scale assessment of lake ice loss is absent. Here, using observations from 513 lakes around the Northern Hemisphere, we identify lakes vulnerable to ice-free winters. Our analyses reveal the importance of air temperature, lake depth, elevation and shoreline complexity in governing ice cover. We estimate that 14,800 lakes currently experience intermittent winter ice cover, increasing to 35,300 and 230,400 at 2 and 8 °C, respectively, and impacting up to 394 and 656 million people. Our study illustrates that an extensive loss of lake ice will occur within the next generation, stressing the importance of climate mitigation strategies to preserve ecosystem structure and function, as well as local winter cultural heritage.",Negative,Undefined

Starting in about 2200 BC, it probably lasted the entire 22nd century BC. It has been hypothesised to have caused the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt as well as the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, and the Liangzhu culture in the lower Yangtze River area.

Effectively, we look at a past climates to infer what our future climate may or may not look like and use that as a guide to prepare us for what is likely to come (one of the great advantages humans have above most organisms, is our ability plan far in advance and prepare for the future). This is crucial, because modern society has spent a lot of time building infrastructure that is susceptible to rising sea levels, and melting permafrost to name just a couple. A growing population demands more use of freely available fresh water for such things as agriculture and industry. The social and economical impacts are profound and we must try to mitigate the effects as much as possible.

But the part I'm looking for is what that 1 degree represents in terms of *total energy*. 

The total heat energy (measured in joules) added to a system the size of the Earth has got to be astronomical!

One really interesting topic in my science classes was the important difference between heat and temperature. For instance, a block of metal and a jar of water might both rise the same degree - but the water takes a LOT more heat energy (joules) to show that difference. And if you take each - a hot metal bar and a jar of hot water - and place them in a room, the room with the water will warm more than the room with the bar. 

Here's a link that goes into it globally:

https://skepticalscience.com/Breaking_News_The_Earth_is_Warming_Still_A_LOT.html

The amount of increased energy discussed - after just a few years - is in the range of ten to the 22nd power - a number with 22 zeros after it. Which is a LOT.

The large-scale Atlantic Ocean circulation moves warm, saline near-surface water from the tropics to far northern latitudes, where it cools, sinks, and returns southward at depth. The fundamental role of this Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for the past, present, and future climate is regularly assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, including the most recent special report on global warming of 1.5°C (1). However, observations of the AMOC are sparse, and scientific knowledge is mainly based on model simulations. On page 516 of this issue, Lozier et al.

___

**Abstract**

Extratropical volcanic eruptions are commonly thought to be less effective at driving large-scale surface cooling than tropical eruptions. However, recent minor extratropical eruptions have produced a measurable climate impact, and proxy records suggest that the most extreme Northern Hemisphere cold period of the Common Era was initiated by an extratropical eruption in 536 ce. Using ice-core-derived volcanic stratospheric sulfur injections and Northern Hemisphere summer temperature reconstructions from tree rings, we show here that in proportion to their estimated stratospheric sulfur injection, extratropical explosive eruptions since 750 ce have produced stronger hemispheric cooling than tropical eruptions. Stratospheric aerosol simulations demonstrate that for eruptions with a sulfur injection magnitude and height equal to that of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, extratropical eruptions produce time-integrated radiative forcing anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics up to 80% greater than tropical eruptions, as decreases in aerosol lifetime are overwhelmed by the enhanced radiative impact associated with the relative confinement of aerosol to a single hemisphere. The model results are consistent with the temperature reconstructions, and elucidate how the radiative forcing produced by extratropical eruptions is strongly dependent on the eruption season and sulfur injection height within the stratosphere.",Positive,Undefined

___

**Abstract**

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is routinely cited as a cost effective tool for climate change mitigation. CCS can directly reduce industrial CO2 emissions and is essential for the retention of CO2 extracted from the atmosphere. To be effective as a climate change mitigation tool, CO2 must be securely retained for 10,000 years (10 ka) with a leakage rate of below 0.01% per year of the total amount of CO2 injected. Migration of CO2 back to the atmosphere via leakage through geological faults is a potential high impact risk to CO2 storage integrity. Here, we calculate for the first time natural leakage rates from a 420 ka paleo-record of CO2 leakage above a naturally occurring, faulted, CO2 reservoir in Arizona, USA. Surface travertine (CaCO3) deposits provide evidence of vertical CO2 leakage linked to known faults. U-Th dating of travertine deposits shows leakage varies along a single fault and that individual seeps have lifespans of up to 200 ka. Whilst the total volumes of CO2 required to form the travertine deposits are high, time-averaged leakage equates to a linear rate of less than 0.01%/yr. Hence, even this natural geological storage site, which would be deemed to be of too high risk to be selected for engineered geologic storage, is adequate to store CO2 for climate mitigation purposes.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

___

**Abstract**

Large-volume pyroclastic eruptions are not known from the basalt-dominated British Palaeogene Igneous Province (BPIP), although silicic magmatism is documented from intra-caldera successions in central volcanoes and from small-volume ash-layers in the associated lava fields. Exceptions are the Sgùrr of Eigg (58.7 Ma) and Òigh-sgeir pitchstones in the Inner Hebrides (&gt;30 km apart), which have been conjectured to represent remnants of a single large silicic event. Currently available major element data from these outcrops differ, however, creating a need to test if the two pitchstones are really related. We employ a systematic array of methods ranging from mineralogy to isotope geochemistry and find that samples from the two outcrops display identical mineral textures and compositions, major- and trace elements, and Sr-Nd-Pb-O isotope ratios, supporting that the two outcrops represent a single, formerly extensive, pyroclastic deposit. Available isotope constraints suggest a vent in the Hebridean Terrane and available radiometric ages point to Skye, ~40 km to the North. A reconstructed eruption volume of ≥5km^3 DRE is derived, suggesting a VEI 5 event or larger. We therefore argue, contrary to long-held perception, that large-volume silicic volcanism and its associated climatic effects were likely integral to the BPIP during the opening of the North Atlantic.",Positive,Global stance
,2019,1,"Methane, Climate Change, and Our Uncertain Future - Methane is generally considered secondary to carbon dioxide in its importance to climate change, but what role might methane play in the future if global temperatures continue to rise?","Study (open access): [Methane Feedbacks to the Global Climate System in a Warmer World](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017RG000559)
___

**Abstract**



Methane (CH4) is produced in many natural systems that are vulnerable to change under a warming climate, yet current CH4 budgets, as well as future shifts in CH4 emissions, have high uncertainties. Climate change has the potential to increase CH4 emissions from critical systems such as wetlands, marine and freshwater systems, permafrost, and methane hydrates, through shifts in temperature, hydrology, vegetation, landscape disturbance, and sea level rise. Increased CH4 emissions from these systems would in turn induce further climate change, resulting in a positive climate feedback. Here we synthesize biological, geochemical, and physically focused CH4 climate feedback literature, bringing together the key findings of these disciplines. We discuss environment‐specific feedback processes, including the microbial, physical, and geochemical interlinkages and the timescales on which they operate, and present the current state of knowledge of CH4 climate feedbacks in the immediate and distant future. The important linkages between microbial activity and climate warming are discussed with the aim to better constrain the sensitivity of the CH4 cycle to future climate predictions. We determine that wetlands will form the majority of the CH4 climate feedback up to 2100. Beyond this timescale, CH4 emissions from marine and freshwater systems and permafrost environments could become more important. Significant CH4 emissions to the atmosphere from the dissociation of methane hydrates are not expected in the near future. Our key findings highlight the importance of quantifying whether CH4 consumption can counterbalance CH4 production under future climate scenarios.

**Plain Language Summary**

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, second only to carbon dioxide in its importance to climate change. Methane production in natural environments is controlled by factors that are themselves influenced by climate. Increased methane production can warm the Earth, which can in turn cause methane to be produced at a faster rate ‐ this is called a positive climate feedback. Here we describe the most important natural environments for methane production that have the potential to produce a positive climate feedback. We discuss how these feedbacks may develop in the coming centuries under predicted climate warming using a cross‐disciplinary approach. We emphasize the importance of considering methane dynamics at all scales, especially its production and consumption and the role microorganisms play in both these processes, to our understanding of current and future global methane emissions. Marrying large‐scale geophysical studies with site‐scale biogeochemical and microbial studies will be key to this.

,2019,1,Managing Uncertainties in Climate Engineering,"&gt;Previous research has shown that when volcanoes located at high latitudes erupt, sulfate aerosols tend to stay in a single hemisphere, whereas when volcanoes located in the tropics erupt, aerosols can be dispersed on a global scale. **Therefore**, to use climate engineering to cool the entire planet, injecting sulfur dioxide into the tropical atmosphere makes sense.

I 100% agree with the part before the **therefore**. Volcanoes at higher latitudes should have a greater effect on the northern hemisphere than the whole globe, and I bet the northern most the volcano the more local the cooling effect and the lesser on global temperatures. The eruption happens above 65N during winter the effect on global temperature is almost 0 (the polar night).

I 100% disagree with the part after the **therefore** for the following reasons:

1. The globe is not warming evenly. [The north hemisphere is warming faster than the south.](https://www.berkeley.edu/news2/2013/04/ITA.jpg). And within the north hemisphere the more north you go, the more it warms. Climate change may be worse for the changes in the temperature gradients from north to south than for global warming.

2. The Arctic sea ice plays a crucial role in the Holocene climate. If there is no ice for the summer heat to consume, it will get very warm very fast. Then the Polar Night comes and temperatures will fall below 0. All that water released by heat and an open Arctic ocean will fall as ungodly snow. If we lose the Arctic sea ice we lose our world.

3. The effects of these injections are temporary, so the best time and place to use them is during summer over the Arctic, when there is maximum insolation. Because it will be day most of the time the cooling effect works 24/7 for the duration of the aerosols.  As an added benefit the very far northern regions are not ads green as the rest of the world and are less inhabited than middle Earth.  ",Positive,Global stance

**Abstract**

Committed warming describes how much future warming can be expected from historical emissions due to inertia in the climate system. It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints, this situation is unlikely, so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018, there is a 64% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 °C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 °C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. Although the challenges laid out by the Paris Agreement are daunting, we indicate 1.5 °C remains possible and is attainable with ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors.",Negative,Undefined

___

**Abstract**

Deep sea geological records indicate that Antarctic ice-sheet growth and decay is strongly influenced by the Earth’s astronomical variations (known as Milankovitch cycles), and that the frequency of the glacial–interglacial cycles changes through time. Here we examine the emergence of a strong obliquity (axial tilt) control on Antarctic ice-sheet evolution during the Miocene by correlating the Antarctic margin geological records from 34 to 5 million years ago with a measure of obliquity sensitivity that compares the variance in deep sea sediment core oxygen-isotope data at obliquity timescales with variance of the calculated obliquity forcing. Our analysis reveals distinct phases of ice-sheet evolution and suggests the sensitivity to obliquity forcing increases when ice-sheet margins extend into marine environments. We propose that this occurs because obliquity-driven changes in the meridional temperature gradient affect the position and strength of the circum-Antarctic easterly flow and enhance (or reduce) ocean heat transport across the Antarctic continental margin. The influence of obliquity-driven changes in ocean dynamics is amplified when marine ice sheets are extensive, and sea ice is limited. Our reconstruction of the Antarctic ice-sheet history suggests that if sea-ice cover decreases in the coming decades, ocean-driven melting at the ice-sheet margin will be amplified.",Positive,Global stance

I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's a short training on How to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/media-training/print-media/writing-effective-letters-to-the-editor/) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show.

I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017).

[Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). 

* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. 

* I gave two presentations to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for.

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Wind-generated ocean waves drive important coastal processes that determine flooding and erosion. Ocean warming has been one factor affecting waves globally. Most studies have focused on studying parameters such as wave heights, but a systematic, global and long-term signal of climate change in global wave behavior remains undetermined. Here we show that the global wave power, which is the transport of the energy transferred from the wind into sea-surface motion, has increased globally (0.4% per year) and by ocean basins since 1948. We also find long-term correlations and statistical dependency with sea surface temperatures, globally and by ocean sub-basins, particularly between the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high south latitudes, the most energetic region globally. Results indicate the upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger. This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator.",Positive,Global stance

___

**Abstract**

Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) rely upon Arctic sea ice as a physical habitat. Consequently, conservation assessments of polar bears identify the ongoing reduction in sea ice to represent a significant threat to their survival. However, the additional role of sea ice as a potential, indirect, source of energy to bears has been overlooked. Here we used the highly branched isoprenoid lipid biomarker-based index (H-Print) approach in combination with quantitative fatty acid signature analysis to show that sympagic (sea ice-associated), rather than pelagic, carbon contributions dominated the marine component of polar bear diet (72–100%; 99% CI, n = 55), irrespective of differences in diet composition. The lowest mean estimates of sympagic carbon were found in Baffin Bay bears, which were also exposed to the most rapidly increasing open water season. Therefore, our data illustrate that for future Arctic ecosystems that are likely to be characterised by reduced sea ice cover, polar bears will not only be impacted by a change in their physical habitat, but also potentially in the supply of energy to the ecosystems upon which they depend. This data represents the first quantifiable baseline that is critical for the assessment of likely ongoing changes in energy supply to Arctic predators as we move into an increasingly uncertain future for polar ecosystems.",Negative,Global stance

**Abstract**

Earth system models are complex and represent a large number of processes, resulting in a persistent spread across climate projections for a given future scenario. Owing to different model performances against observations and the lack of independence among models, there is now evidence that giving equal weight to each available model projection is suboptimal. This Perspective discusses newly developed tools that facilitate a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of model simulations with observations, process-based emergent constraints that are a promising way to focus evaluation on the observations most relevant to climate projections, and advanced methods for model weighting. These approaches are needed to distil the most credible information on regional climate changes, impacts, and risks for stakeholders and policy-makers.",Positive,Global stance

___

**Significance**

Since the 19th century, rising greenhouse gas concentrations have caused the ocean to absorb most of the Earth’s excess heat and warm up. Before the 1990s, most ocean temperature measurements were above 700 m and therefore, insufficient for an accurate global estimate of ocean warming. We present a method to reconstruct ocean temperature changes with global, full-depth ocean coverage, revealing warming of 436 ×10^21 J since 1871. Our reconstruction, which agrees with other estimates for the well-observed period, demonstrates that the ocean absorbed as much heat during 1921–1946 as during 1990–2015. Since the 1950s, up to one-half of excess heat in the Atlantic Ocean at midlatitudes has come from other regions via circulation-related changes in heat transport.

**Abstact**

Most of the excess energy stored in the climate system due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been taken up by the oceans, leading to thermal expansion and sea-level rise. The oceans thus have an important role in the Earth’s energy imbalance. Observational constraints on future anthropogenic warming critically depend on accurate estimates of past ocean heat content (OHC) change. We present a reconstruction of OHC since 1871, with global coverage of the full ocean depth. Our estimates combine timeseries of observed sea surface temperatures with much longer historical coverage than those in the ocean interior together with a representation (a Green’s function) of time-independent ocean transport processes. For 1955–2017, our estimates are comparable with direct estimates made by infilling the available 3D time-dependent ocean temperature observations. We find that the global ocean absorbed heat during this period at a rate of 0.30 ± 0.06 W/m^2 in the upper 2,000 m and 0.028 ± 0.026 W/m^2 below 2,000 m, with large decadal fluctuations. The total OHC change since 1871 is estimated at 436 ± 91 ×10^21 J, with an increase during 1921–1946 (145 ± 62 ×10^21 J) that is as large as during 1990–2015. By comparing with direct estimates, we also infer that, during 1955–2017, up to one-half of the Atlantic Ocean warming and thermosteric sea-level rise at low latitudes to midlatitudes emerged due to heat convergence from changes in ocean transport.",Positive,Global stance

A new study shows that the leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes is also a master builder and cultivator and a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.,"I haven't had the time yet to go through this particular study at length, however, a cursory read through of the article you provide pointing to a value of 862 tetragrams suggests one should note the technical differences between the article and the findings of this study.

Furthermore, this study only looks at soil carbon, no other sources or sinks. The implication is that your back of the envelope estimation of 4-5 metric megatons is far too high and needs to be revised within the scope of this study.

""*A reasonable range of soil CO2 efflux rates in this forest is 4 to 7 kg CO2 m^(-2) yr^(-1) (as in this study, and in Schwendenmann &amp; Veldkamp, 2006), and nest surface area ranges from 30 to 70 m^2 (Wirth et al. 2003, based on Perfecto &amp; Vandermeer, 1993; Table 2; Table S5). Given these values, soil ground surface of a nest emits 120 to 490 kg CO2 annually. For vent efflux, based on an observed average vent efflux value of 2.1·10^(4)kg CO2 m^(-2) yr^(-1), an average of 32 vents per mature nest, and average vent opening (0.00021 m^(2)), the total vent CO2 emissions is about 72 kg CO2 yr^(-1). These values suggest that an average Atta cephalotes nest area emits around 200 kg to 600 kg CO2
per nest and year, i.e., 15% to 60% more than an equivalent area of soil in a lowland tropical forest... at least 1.2% of the La Selva surface of primary and secondary forest was occupied by Atta cephalotes nests. That is equivalent to an additional 0.2% to 0.7% contribution of CO2 from Atta cephalotes in this Neotropical rainforest.*""  ",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

**Abstract**

Leaf‐cutter ants are dominant herbivores that disturb the soil and create biogeochemical hot spots. We studied how leaf‐cutter ant Atta cephalotes impacts soil CO2 dynamics in a wet Neotropical forest. We measured soil CO2 concentration monthly over 2.5 years at multiple depths in non‐nest and nest soils (some of which were abandoned during the study) and assessed CO2 production. We also measured nest and non‐nest soil efflux, nest vent efflux and vent concentration. Nest soils exhibited lower CO2 accumulation than non‐nest soils for the same precipitation amounts. During wet periods, soil CO2 concentrations increased across all depths, but were significantly less in nest than in non‐nest soils. Differences were non‐significant during drier periods. Surface efflux was equal across nest and non‐nest plots (5 μmol CO2 m^(‐2) s^(‐1)), while vent efflux was substantially (10^(3) to 10^(5) times) greater, a finding attributed to free convection and sporadic forced convection. Vent CO2 concentrations were less than in soil, suggesting CO2 efflux from the soil matrix into the nest. Legacy effects in abandoned nests were still observable after more than two years. These findings indicate that leaf‐cutter ant nests provide alternative transport pathways to soil CO2 that increase total emissions and decrease soil CO2 concentrations, and have a lasting impact. Estimated total nest‐soil CO2 emissions were 15 to 60% more than in non‐nest soils, equivalent to 0.2 to 0.7% greater ecosystem‐scale soil emissions. The observed CO2 dynamics illuminate the significant carbon footprint of ecosystem engineer Atta cephalotes and have biogeochemical implications for rainforest ecosystems.

**Plain Language Summary**

Leaf‐cutter ants modify their habitat to the extent that they are called ecosystem engineers. Living throughout the Americas, they construct massive nests to which they import the vegetation they harvest to feed a fungus they cultivate as their main food source. We studied the most common leaf‐cutter ant in Costa Rica to assess the impact of its nests on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in surrounding soils and on soil CO2 emissions. In the Costa Rican rainforest, heavy rains easily clog the clayey soils, accumulating CO2 from microbial and root respiration. During wet periods, we observed lower CO2 concentrations in nest soils relative to non‐nest soils. We attribute this difference to the nest structure, which provides ventilation for both nest CO2 and the CO2 originated in the surrounding soil. We also found that soil CO2 emissions were the same in nest and non‐nest soils, but nest openings had emissions 100,000 times greater. Consequently, nests and their surrounding soils emit 15 to 60% more CO2 than the equivalent non‐nest soil areas. This difference, together with the expanding range of leaf‐cutter ants, favored by human activities and warmer climate, has implications with respect to the global carbon cycle.",Positive,Seriousness of gas emissions

___

**Deep Pacific cooling**

Earth's climate cooled considerably across the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age about 700 years ago. Theoretically, owing to how the ocean circulates, this cooling should be recorded in Pacific deep-ocean temperatures, where water that was on the surface then is found today. Gebbie and Huybers used an ocean circulation model and observations from both the end of the 19th century and the end of the 20th century to detect and quantify this trend. The ongoing deep Pacific is cooling, which revises Earth's overall heat budget since 1750 downward by 35%.

**Abstract**

Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent cooling occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.",Positive,Global stance

",2019,1,Timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer,"When people talk about ice-free, they usually define it by some sea ice extent (surface area) metric, rather than sea ice volume. The relationship between sea ice extent and sea ice volume is not linear, so even if the future evolution of sea ice volume were linear, you still might not get an ice free summer if looking at a sea-ice extent metric. Sea ice volume is decreasing faster than sea ice extent because the sea ice is thinning as well as laterally shrinking.

If you repeat the same exercise you did above by [extrapolating the trend in sea ice extent](http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2018/12/Figure-3.png), you find that you won't see summers with less than 1 Million Sq Km of sea ice extent until ~2050s.

1) The way Wang and Overland (2012) come up with ice free summer conditions ""in the 2030s"" are, in my opinion, very hand-wavy. The number that the models actually give them are:

""If we consider 1.0 million km2 as the summer ice free
condition (the horizontal dashed line crossing the colored lines
in Figure 2), then under the RCP8.5 scenario (magenta lines in
Figure 2) this condition will be reached by the ensemble
members of the seven selected models by 2040–2060.""

They use a fairly unjustified extrapolation to argue that the 2040-2060 range is maybe an overestimate because models are not accurately modelling the observed sea ice trends of the 20th century and come up with their ""2030s"" value.

2) Even the 2040-2060 value is already kind of sketchy to use as a prediction. It assumes we continue on a RCP8.5 trajectory, which I personally think is unlikely between now and 2040.

",2019,1,Timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer,"Right, I agree there's a good chance that the loss in extent will end up being non-linear, as the ice thins and albedo decreases, etc. According to [Wang and Overland (2012)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2012GL052868), the models that best reproduce the recent observed trends would predict “ice free” (defined as less than 1 million km^2 area) conditions by the 2030s.",Positive,Undefined
"I found an earlier discussion on the timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer (https://www.reddit.com/r/climate_science/comments/82rxst/blue_ocean_event_unsure_where_to_find_information/) and the most upvoted comment is one stating that the arctic won't be ice free in summer until the 2040's or 2050's, this being presumably motivated by models.

",2019,1,Timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer,"Yes, but it's quite possible to have situation where area remains high until volume hits very small values. After all, if volume is zero then extent must be zero, so surely one must go by volume?

",2019,1,Timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer,"The trendline differs quite a bit, depending on whether you’re looking at sea ice extent (area), or volume. I just quickly made a graph of the minimum monthly values reported for sea ice extent ([NOAA data via NSIDC](ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/monthly/data/)) and volume ([PIOMAS](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/PIOMAS.2sst.monthly.Current.v2.1.txt) data), and added a simple linear trendline for each. Based on that, the line would cross “0” at about 2032 using volume, and about 2073 using extent/area. [See here for the graph](https://imgur.com/a/GcU7Oof).",Positive,Undefined
